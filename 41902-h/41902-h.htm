<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page1" id="page1"></a>1</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">L<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> &emsp;a letter which was the twelfth letter of the Phoenician
alphabet. It has in its history passed through many
changes of form, ending curiously enough in its usual
manuscript form with a shape almost identical with that
which it had about 900 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (<img style="width:36px; height:25px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1a.jpg" alt="" />). As was the case with B
and some other letters the Greeks did not everywhere keep the
symbol in the position in which they had borrowed it <img style="width:14px; height:22px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1b.jpg" alt="" />. This,
which was its oldest form in Attica and in the Chalcidian colonies
of Italy, was the form adopted by the Romans, who in time
converted it into the rectangle <img style="width:15px; height:16px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1c.jpg" alt="" />, which passed from them to the
nations of western Europe. In the Ionic alphabet, however,
from which the ordinary Greek alphabet is derived it appeared
as <img style="width:16px; height:19px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1d.jpg" alt="" />. A still more common form in other parts of Greece was <img style="width:13px; height:19px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1e.jpg" alt="" />,
with the legs of unequal length. The editors of Herodotus have
not always recognized that the name of Labda, the mother of
Cypselus, in the story (v. 92) of the founding of the great family
of Corinthian despots, was derived from the fact that she was
lame and so suggested the form of the Corinthian <img style="width:13px; height:19px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1e.jpg" alt="" />. Another
form <img style="width:18px; height:23px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1f.jpg" alt="" /> or <img style="width:13px; height:19px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1g.jpg" alt="" /> was practically confined to the west of Argolis.
The name of the Greek letter is ordinarily given as <i>Lambda</i>, but
in Herodotus (above) and in Athenaeus x. p. 453 <i>e</i>, where the
names of the letters are given, the best authenticated form is
<i>Labda</i>. The Hebrew name, which was probably identical with
the Phoenician, is <i>Lamed</i>, which, with a final vowel added as
usual, would easily become <i>Lambda</i>, <i>b</i> being inserted between
<i>m</i> and another consonant. The pronunciation of <i>l</i> varies a
great deal according to the point at which the tongue makes
contact with the roof of the mouth. The contact, generally
speaking, is at the same point as for <i>d</i>, and this accounts for an
interchange between these sounds which occurs in various
languages, <i>e.g.</i> in Latin <i>lacrima</i> from the same root as the Greek
<span class="grk" title="dakru">&#948;&#940;&#954;&#961;&#965;</span> and the English <i>tear</i>. The change in Latin occurs in a
very limited number of cases and one explanation of their
occurrence is that they are borrowed (Sabine) words. In pronunciation
the breath may be allowed to escape at one or both
sides of the tongue. In most languages <i>l</i> is a fairly stable sound.
Orientals, however, have much difficulty in distinguishing
between <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>. In Old Persian <i>l</i> is found in only two foreign
words, and in Sanskrit different dialects employ <i>r</i> and <i>l</i> differently
in the same words. Otherwise, however, the interchanges
between <i>r</i> and <i>l</i> were somewhat exaggerated by the older philologists.
Before other consonants <i>l</i> becomes silent in not a few
languages, notably in French, where it is replaced by <i>u</i>, and in
English where it has occasionally been restored in recent times,
<i>e.g.</i> in <i>fault</i> which earlier was spelt without <i>l</i> (as in French whence
it was borrowed), and which Goldsmith could still rhyme with
<i>aught</i>. In the 15th century the Scottish dialect of English
dropped <i>l</i> largely both before consonants and finally after <i>a</i> and
<i>&#363;</i>, <i>a</i>&rsquo; = all, <i>fa</i>&rsquo; = fall, <i>pu</i>&rsquo; = pull, &rsquo;<i>oo</i>&rsquo; = wool, <i>bulk</i> pronounced like
<i>book</i>, &amp;c., while after <i>o</i> it appears as <i>w</i>, <i>row</i> (pronounced <i>rau</i>) = roll,
<i>know</i> = knoll, &amp;c. It is to be observed that <img style="width:15px; height:16px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1c.jpg" alt="" /> = 50 does not
come from this symbol, but was an adaptation of <img style="width:14px; height:19px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1h.jpg" alt="" />, the western
Greek form of &chi;, which had no corresponding sound in Latin
and was therefore not included in the ordinary alphabet. This
symbol was first rounded into <img style="width:22px; height:21px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1i.jpg" alt="" /> and then changed first to <img style="width:17px; height:18px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1j.jpg" alt="" />,
and ultimately to <img style="width:15px; height:16px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img1c.jpg" alt="" />.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAACHER SEE,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> a lake of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine
Province, 5 m. W. of Brohl on the Rhine, and N. of the village
of Niedermendig. It occupies what is supposed to be a crater
of the Eifel volcanic formation, and the pumice stone and basalt
found in great quantities around it lend credence to this theory.
It lies 850 ft. above the sea, is 5 m. in circumference and 160 ft.
deep, and is surrounded by an amphitheatre of high hills. The
water is sky blue in colour, very cold and bitter to the taste.
The lake has no natural outlet and consequently is subjected
to a considerable rise and fall. On the western side lies the
Benedictine abbey of St Maria Laach (<i>Abballa Lacensis</i>) founded
in 1093 by Henry II., count palatine of the Rhine. The abbey
church, dating from the 12th century, was restored in 1838.
The history of the monastery down to modern times appears to
have been uneventful. In 1802 it was abolished and at the close
of the Napoleonic wars it became a Prussian state demesne.
In 1863 it passed into the hands of the Jesuits, who, down to
their expulsion in 1873, published here a periodical, which still
appears, entitled <i>Stimmen aus Maria Laach</i>. In 1892 the
monastery was again occupied by the Benedictines.</p>

encampment, formed by a circle of wagons. The English word
is &ldquo;leaguer,&rdquo; an armed camp, especially that of a besieging or
&ldquo;beleaguering&rdquo; army. The Ger. <i>lager</i>, in the sense of &ldquo;store,&rdquo;
is familiar as the name of a light beer (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brewing</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAAS, ERNST<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (1837-1885), German philosopher, was born
on the 16th of June 1837 at Fürstenwalde. He studied theology
and philosophy under Trendelenburg at Berlin, and eventually
became professor of philosophy in the new university of Strassburg.
In <i>Kant&rsquo;s Analogien der Erfahrung</i> (1876) he keenly
criticized Kant&rsquo;s transcendentalism, and in his chief work
<i>Idealismus und Positivismus</i> (3 vols., 1879-1884), he drew a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>
clear contrast between Platonism, from which he derived transcendentalism,
and positivism, of which he considered Protagoras
the founder. Laas in reality was a disciple of Hume.
Throughout his philosophy he endeavours to connect metaphysics
with ethics and the theory of education.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His chief educational works were <i>Der deutsche Aufsatz in den
obern Gymnasialklassen</i> (1868; 3rd ed., part i., 1898, part ii, 1894),
and <i>Der deutsche Unterricht auf höhern Lehranstalten</i> (1872; 2nd ed.
1886). He contributed largely to the <i>Vierteljahrsschr. f. wiss. Philos.</i>
(1880-1882); the <i>Litterarischer Nachlass</i>, a posthumous collection,
was published at Vienna (1887). See Hanisch, <i>Der Positivismus von

<p><span class="bold">LA BADIE, JEAN DE<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> (1610-1674), French divine, founder of
the school known as the Labadists, was born at Bourg, not far
from Bordeaux, on the 13th of February 1610, being the son of
Jean Charles de la Badie, governor of Guienne. He was sent
to the Jesuit school at Bordeaux, and when fifteen entered the
Jesuit college there. In 1626 he began to study philosophy
and theology. He was led to hold somewhat extreme views
about the efficacy of prayer and the direct influence of the Holy
Spirit upon believers, and adopted Augustinian views about
grace, free will and predestination, which brought him into
collision with his order. He therefore separated from the
Jesuits, and then became a preacher to the people, carrying on
this work in Bordeaux, Paris and Amiens. At Amiens in 1640
he was appointed a canon and teacher of theology. The hostility
of Cardinal Mazarin, however, forced him to retire to the Carmelite
hermitage at Graville. A study of Calvin&rsquo;s <i>Institutes</i>
showed him that he had more in common with the Reformed
than with the Roman Catholic Church, and after various
adventures he joined the Reformed Church of France and
became professor of theology at Montauban in 1650. His reasons
for doing so he published in the same year in his <i>Déclaration
de Jean de la Badie</i>. His accession to the ranks of the Protestants
was deemed a great triumph; no such man since Calvin
himself, it was said, had left the Roman Catholic Church.
He was called to the pastorate of the church at Orange on the
Rhone in 1657, and at once became noted for his severity of
discipline. He set his face zealously against dancing, card-playing
and worldly entertainments. The unsettled state of
the country, recently annexed to France, compelled him to leave
Orange, and in 1659 he became a pastor in Geneva. He then
accepted a call to the French church in London, but after
various wanderings settled at Middelburg, where he was pastor
to the French-speaking congregation at a Walloon church.
His peculiar opinions were by this time (1666) well known, and
he and his congregation found themselves in conflict with the
ecclesiastical authorities. The result was that la Badie and his
followers established a separate church in a neighbouring town.
In 1669 he moved to Amsterdam. He had enthusiastic disciples,
Pierre Yvon (1646-1707) at Montauban, Pierre Dulignon
(d. 1679), François Menuret (d. 1670), Theodor Untereyk (d.
1693), F. Spanheim (1632-1701), and, more important than
any, Anna Maria v. Schürman (1607-1678), whose book <i>Eucleria</i>
is perhaps the best exposition of the tenets of her master. At
the head of his separatist congregation, la Badie developed his
views for a reformation of the Reformed Churches: the church
is a communion of holy people who have been born again from
sin; baptism is the sign and seal of this regeneration, and is
to be administered only to believers; the Holy Spirit guides
the regenerate into all truth, and the church possesses throughout
all time those gifts of prophecy which it had in the ancient days;
the community at Jerusalem is the continual type of every
Christian congregation, therefore there should be a community
of goods, the disciples should live together, eat together, dance
together; marriage is a holy ordinance between two believers,
and the children of the regenerate are born without original
sin, marriage with an unregenerate person is not binding.
They did not observe the Sabbath, because&mdash;so they said&mdash;their
life was a continual Sabbath. The life and separatism of the
community brought them into frequent collision with their
neighbours and with the magistrates, and in 1670 they accepted

<p><span class="bold">LABEL<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (a French word, now represented by <i>lambeau</i>, possibly
a variant; it is of obscure origin and may be connected with a
Teutonic word appearing in the English &ldquo;lap,&rdquo; a flap or fold),
a slip, ticket, or card of paper, metal or other material, attached
to an object, such as a parcel, bottle, &amp;c., and containing a name,
address, description or other information, for the purpose of
identification. Originally the word meant a band or ribbon
of linen or other material, and was thus applied to the fillets
(<i>infulae</i>) attached to a bishop&rsquo;s mitre. In heraldry the
&ldquo;label&rdquo; is a mark of &ldquo;cadency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In architecture the term &ldquo;label&rdquo; is applied to the outer
projecting moulding over doors, windows, arches, &amp;c., sometimes
called &ldquo;Dripstone&rdquo; or &ldquo;Weather Moulding,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hood
Mould.&rdquo; The former terms seem scarcely applicable, as this
moulding is often inside a building where no rain could
come, and consequently there is no drip. In Norman times
the label frequently did not project, and when it did it was
very little, and formed part of the series of arch mouldings. In
the Early English styles they were not very large, sometimes
slightly undercut, sometimes deeply, sometimes a quarter round
with chamfer, and very frequently a &ldquo;roll&rdquo; or &ldquo;scroll-moulding,&rdquo;
so called because it resembles the part of a scroll where the edge
laps over the body of the roll. Labels generally resemble the
string-courses of the period, and, in fact, often return horizontally
and form strings. They are less common in Continental architecture
than in English.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABEO, MARCUS ANTISTIUS<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 50 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 18), Roman
jurist, was the son of Pacuvius Antistius Labeo, a jurist who
caused himself to be slain after the defeat of his party at Philippi.
A member of the plebeian nobility, and in easy circumstances,
the younger Labeo early entered public life, and soon rose to
the praetorship; but his undisguised antipathy to the new
régime, and the somewhat brusque manner in which in the
senate he occasionally gave expression to his republican
sympathies&mdash;what Tacitus (<i>Ann.</i> iii. 75) calls his <i>incorrupta libertas</i>&mdash;proved
an obstacle to his advancement, and his rival, Ateius
Capito, who had unreservedly given in his adhesion to the
ruling powers, was promoted by Augustus to the consulate,
when the appointment should have fallen to Labeo; smarting
under the wrong done him, Labeo declined the office when it
was offered to him in a subsequent year (Tac. <i>Ann.</i> iii. 75;
Pompon, in fr. 47, <i>Dig.</i> i. 2). From this time he seems to have
devoted his whole time to jurisprudence. His training in the
science had been derived principally from Trebatius Testa.
To his knowledge of the law he added a wide general culture,
devoting his attention specially to dialectics, philology (<i>grammatica</i>),
and antiquities, as valuable aids in the exposition,
expansion, and application of legal doctrine (Gell. xiii. 10).
Down to the time of Hadrian his was probably the name of
greatest authority; and several of his works were abridged
and annotated by later hands. While Capito is hardly ever
referred to, the dicta of Labeo are of constant recurrence in the
writings of the classical jurists, such as Gaius, Ulpian and Paul;
and no inconsiderable number of them were thought worthy
of preservation in Justinian&rsquo;s <i>Digest</i>. Labeo gets the credit
of being the founder of the Proculian sect or school, while
Capito is spoken of as the founder of the rival Sabinian one
(Pomponius in fr. 47, <i>Dig.</i> i. 2); but it is probable that the
real founders of the two <i>scholae</i> were Proculus and Sabinus,
followers respectively of the methods of Labeo and Capito.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Labeo&rsquo;s most important literary work was the <i>Libri Posteriorum</i>,
so called because published only after his death. It contained a
systematic exposition of the common law. His <i>Libri ad Edictum</i>
embraced a commentary, not only on the edicts of the urban and
peregrine praetors, but also on that of the curule aediles. His
<i>Probabilium</i> (<span class="grk" title="pithanôn">&#960;&#953;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</span>) <i>lib. VIII.</i>, a collection of definitions and
axiomatic legal propositions, seems to have been one of his most
characteristic productions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABERIUS, DECIMUS<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 105-43 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Roman knight and
writer of mimes. He seems to have been a man of caustic wit,
who wrote for his own pleasure. In 45 Julius Caesar ordered
him to appear in one of his own mimes in a public contest with
the actor Publilius Syrus. Laberius pronounced a dignified
prologue on the degradation thus thrust on his sixty years,
and directed several sharp allusions against the dictator. Caesar
awarded the victory to Publilius, but restored Laberius to his
equestrian rank, which he had forfeited by appearing as a mimus
(Macrobius, <i>Sat.</i> ii. 7). Laberius was the chief of those who
introduced the mimus into Latin literature towards the close
of the republican period. He seems to have been a man of
learning and culture, but his pieces did not escape the coarseness
inherent to the class of literature to which they belonged;
and Aulus Gellius (xvi. 7, 1) accuses him of extravagance in
the coining of new words. Horace (<i>Sat.</i> i. 10) speaks of him in
terms of qualified praise.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In addition to the prologue (in Macrobius), the titles of forty-four
of his mimi have been preserved; the fragments have been collected
by O. Ribbeck in his <i>Comicorum Latinorum reliquiae</i> (1873).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABIATAE<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;lipped,&rdquo; Lat. <i>labium</i>, lip), in botany, a
natural order of seed-plants belonging to the series Tubiflorae
of the dicotyledons, and containing about 150 genera with
2800 species. The majority are annual or perennial herbs
inhabiting the temperate zone, becoming shrubby in warmer
climates. The stem is generally square in section and the simple
exstipulate leaves are arranged in decussating pairs (<i>i.e.</i> each
pair is in a plane at right angles to that of the pairs immediately
above and below it); the blade is entire, or toothed, lobed
or more or less deeply cut. The plant is often hairy, and the hairs
are frequently glandular, the secretion containing a scent
characteristic of the genus or species. The flowers are borne
in the axils of the leaves or bracts; they are rarely solitary
as in <i>Scutellaria</i> (skull-cap), and generally form an apparent
whorl (<i>verticillaster</i>) at the node, consisting of a pair of cymose
inflorescences each of which is a simple three-flowered dichasium
as in <i>Brunella</i>, <i>Salvia</i>, &amp;c., or more generally a dichasium passing
over into a pair of monochasial cymes as in <i>Lamium</i> (fig. 1),
<i>Ballota</i>, <i>Nepeta</i>, &amp;c. A number of whorls may be crowded at the
apex of the stem and the subtending leaves reduced to small
bracts, the whole forming a raceme- or spike-like inflorescence
as in <i>Mentha</i> (fig. 2, <i>5</i>) <i>Brunella</i>, &amp;c.; the bracts are sometimes
large and coloured as in <i>Monarda</i>, species of <i>Salvia</i>, &amp;c., in the
latter the apex of the stem is sometimes occupied with a cluster
of sterile coloured bracts. The plan of the flower is remarkably
uniform (fig. 1, <i>3</i>); it is bisexual, and zygomorphic in the

median plane, with 5 sepals united to form a persistent cup-like
calyx, 5 petals united to form a two-lipped gaping corolla,
4 stamens inserted on the corolla-tube, two of which, generally
the anterior pair, are longer than the other two (didynamous
arrangement)&mdash;sometimes as in <i>Salvia</i>, the posterior pair is
aborted&mdash;and two superior median carpels, each very early
divided by a constriction in a vertical plane, the pistil consisting
of four cells each containing one erect anatropous ovule attached
to the base of an axile placenta; the style springs from the
centre of the pistil between the four segments (<i>gynobasic</i>), and
is simple with a bifid apex. The fruit comprises four one-seeded
nutlets included in the persistent calyx; the seed has a thin
testa and the embryo almost or completely fills it. Although
the general form and plan of arrangement of the flower is very
uniform, there are wide variations in detail. Thus the calyx
may be tubular, bell-shaped, or almost spherical, or straight
or bent, and the length and form of the teeth or lobes varies
also; it may be equally toothed as in mint (<i>Mentha</i>) (fig. 2,
<i>3</i>), and marjoram (<i>Origanum</i>), or two-lipped as in thyme
(<i>Thymus</i>), <i>Lamium</i> (fig. 1) and <i>Salvia</i> (fig. 2, <i>1</i>); the number
of nerves affords useful characters for distinction of genera,
there are normally five main nerves between which simple or
forked secondary nerves are more or less developed. The shape
of the corolla varies widely, the differences being doubtless
intimately associated with the pollination of the flowers by insect-agency.
The tube is straight or variously bent and often
widens towards the mouth. Occasionally the limb is equally
five-toothed, or forms, as in <i>Mentha</i> (fig. 2, <i>3</i>, <i>4</i>) an almost
regular four-toothed corolla by union of the two posterior teeth.
Usually it is two-lipped, the upper lip being formed by the two
posterior, the lower lip by the three anterior petals (see fig. 1,
and fig. 2, <i>1</i>, <i>6</i>); the median lobe of the lower lip is generally
most developed and forms a resting-place for the bee or other
insect when probing the flower for honey, the upper lip shows
great variety in form, often, as in <i>Lamium</i> (fig. 1), <i>Stachys</i>, &amp;c.,
it is arched forming a protection from rain for the stamens,
or it may be flat as in thyme. In the tribe <i>Ocimoideae</i> the four
upper petals form the upper lip, and the single anterior one
the lower lip, and in <i>Teucrium</i> the upper lip is absent, all five
lobes being pushed forward to form the lower. The posterior
stamen is sometimes present as a staminode, but generally
suppressed; the upper pair are often reduced to staminodes
or more or less completely suppressed as in <i>Salvia</i> (fig. 2, <i>2</i>, <i>6</i>);
rarely are these developed and the anterior pair reduced. In
<i>Coleus</i> the stamens are monadelphous. In <i>Nepeta</i> and allied
genera the posterior pair are the longer, but this is rare, the
didynamous character being generally the result of the anterior
pair being the longer. The anthers are two-celled, each cell
splitting lengthwise; the connective may be more or less
developed between the cells; an extreme case is seen in <i>Salvia</i>
(fig. 2, <i>2</i>), where the connective is filiform and jointed to the
filament, while the anterior anther-cell is reduced to a sterile
appendage. Honey is secreted by a hypogynous disk. In the
more general type of flower the anthers and stigmas are protected
by the arching upper lip as in dead-nettle (fig. 1) and many
other British genera; the lower lip affords a resting-place for
the insect which in probing the flower for the honey, secreted
on the lower side of the disk, collects pollen on its back.
Numerous variations in detail are found in the different genera;
in <i>Salvia</i> (fig. 2), for instance, there is a lever mechanism, the
barren half of each anther forming a knob at the end of a short
arm which when touched by the head of an insect causes the
anther at the end of the longer arm to descend on the insect&rsquo;s
back. In the less common type, where the anterior part of the
flower is more developed, as in the <i>Ocimoideae</i>, the stamens
and style lie on the under lip and honey is secreted on the upper
side of the hypogynous disk; the insect in probing the flower
gets smeared with pollen on its belly and legs. Both types
include brightly-coloured flowers with longer tubes adapted to
the visits of butterflies and moths, as species of <i>Salvia</i>, <i>Stachys</i>,
<i>Monarda</i>, &amp;c.; some South American species of <i>Salvia</i> are
pollinated by humming-birds. In <i>Mentha</i> (fig. 2, <i>3</i>), thyme,
marjoram (<i>Origanum</i>), and allied genera, the flowers are nearly
regular and the stamens spread beyond the corolla.</p>

<p>The persistent calyx encloses the ripe nutlets, and aids in
their distribution in various ways, by means of winged spiny
or hairy lobes or teeth; sometimes it forms a swollen bladder.
A scanty endosperm is sometimes present in the seed; the
embryo is generally parallel to the fruit axis with a short inferior
radicle and generally flat cotyledons.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The order occurs in all warm and temperate regions; its chief
centre is the Mediterranean region, where some genera such as
<i>Lavandula</i>, <i>Thymus</i>, <i>Rosmarinus</i> and others form an important
feature in the vegetation. The tribe <i>Ocimoideae</i> is exclusively
tropical and subtropical and occurs in both hemispheres. The order
is well represented in Britain by seventeen native genera; <i>Mentha</i>
(mint) including also <i>M. piperita</i> (peppermint) and <i>M. Pulegium</i>
(pennyroyal); <i>Origanum vulgare</i> (marjoram); <i>Thymus Serpyllum</i>
(thyme); <i>Calamintha</i> (calamint), including also <i>C. Clinopodium</i>
(wild basil) and <i>C. Acinos</i> (basil thyme); <i>Salvia</i> (sage), including
<i>S. Verbenaca</i> (clary); <i>Nepeta Cataria</i> (catmint), <i>N. Glechoma</i>
(ground-ivy); <i>Brunella</i> (self-heal); <i>Scutellaria</i> (skull-cap); <i>Stachys</i>
(woundwort); <i>S. Betonica</i> is wood betony; <i>Galeopsis</i> (hemp-nettle);
<i>Lamium</i> (dead-nettle); <i>Ballota</i> (black horehound); <i>Teucrium</i>
(germander); and <i>Ajuga</i> (bugle).</p>

<p>Labiatae are readily distinguished from all other orders of the
series excepting Verbenaceae, in which, however, the style is
terminal; but several genera, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Ajuga</i>, <i>Teucrium</i> and <i>Rosmarinus</i>,
approach Verbenaceae in this respect, and in some genera of that
order the style is more or less sunk between the ovary lobes. The
fruit-character indicates an affinity with Boraginaceae from which,
however, they differ in habit and by characters of ovule and embryo.</p>

<p>The presence of volatile oil renders many genera of economic use,
such are thyme, marjoram (<i>Origanum</i>), sage (<i>Salvia</i>), lavender
(<i>Lavandula</i>), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus</i>), patchouli (<i>Pogostemon</i>). The
tubers of <i>Stachys Sieboldi</i> are eaten in France.</p>

Tusculum, that it was then prolonged to Labici, and later still
became a road for through traffic; it may even have superseded
the Via Latina as a route to the S.E., for, while the distance
from Rome to their main junction at Ad Bivium (or to another
junction at Compitum Anagninum) is practically identical, the
summit level of the former is 725 ft. lower than that of the
latter, a little to the west of the pass of Algidus. After their
junction it is probable that the road bore the name Via Latina
rather than Via Labicana. The course of the road after the
first six miles from Rome is not identical with that of any modern
road, but can be clearly traced by remains of pavement and
buildings along its course.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABICHE, EUGÈNE MARIN<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (1815-1888), French dramatist,
was born on the 5th of May 1815, of <i>bourgeois</i> parentage. He
read for the bar, but literature had more powerful attractions,
and he was hardly twenty when he gave to the <i>Chérubin</i>&mdash;an
impertinent little magazine, long vanished and forgotten&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span>
short story, entitled, in the cavalier style of the period, <i>Les
plus belles sont les plus fausses</i>. A few others followed much in
the same strain, but failed to catch the attention of the public.
He tried his hand at dramatic criticism in the <i>Revue des théâtres</i>,
and in 1838 made a double venture on the stage. The small
Théâtre du Panthéon produced, amid some signs of popular
favour, a drama of his, <i>L&rsquo;Avocat Loubet</i>, while a vaudeville,
<i>Monsieur de Coislin ou l&rsquo;homme infiniment poli</i>, written in
collaboration with Marc Michel, and given at the Palais Royal,
introduced for the first time to the Parisians a provincial actor
who was to become and to remain a great favourite with them,
Grassot, the famous low comedian. In the same year Labiche,
still doubtful about his true vocation, published a romance
called <i>La Clé des champs</i>. M. Léon Halévy, his successor at
the Academy and his panegyrist, informs us that the publisher
became a bankrupt soon after the novel was out. &ldquo;A lucky
misadventure, for,&rdquo; the biographer concludes, &ldquo;this timely
warning of Destiny sent him back to the stage, where a career
of success was awaiting him.&rdquo; There was yet another obstacle
in the way. When he married, he solemnly promised his wife&rsquo;s
parents that he would renounce a profession then considered
incompatible with moral regularity and domestic happiness.
But a year afterwards his wife spontaneously released him from
his vow, and Labiche recalled the incident when he dedicated
the first edition of his complete works: &ldquo;To my wife.&rdquo; Labiche,
in conjunction with Varin,<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Marc Michel,<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Clairville,<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
Dumanoir,<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a> and others contributed comic plays interspersed with couplets
to various Paris theatres. The series culminated in the memorable
farce in five acts, <i>Un Chapeau de paille d&rsquo;Italie</i> (August
1851). It remains an accomplished specimen of the French
<i>imbroglio</i>, in which some one is in search of something, but does
not find it till five minutes before the curtain falls. Prior to
that date Labiche had been only a successful <i>vaudevilliste</i> among
a crowd of others; but a twelvemonth later he made a new
departure in <i>Le Misanthrope et l&rsquo;Auvergnat</i>. All the plays
given for the next twenty-five years, although constructed on
the old plan, contained a more or less appreciable dose of
that comic observation and good sense which gradually raised
the French farce almost to the level of the comedy of character
and manners. &ldquo;Of all the subjects,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which offered
themselves to me, I have selected the <i>bourgeois</i>. Essentially
mediocre in his vices and in his virtues, he stands half-way
between the hero and the scoundrel, between the saint and the
profligate.&rdquo; During the second period of his career Labiche
had the collaboration of Delacour,<a name="fa5a" id="fa5a" href="#ft5a"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Choler,<a name="fa6a" id="fa6a" href="#ft6a"><span class="sp">6</span></a> and others. When
it is asked what share in the authorship and success of the plays
may be claimed for those men, we shall answer in Émile Augier&rsquo;s
words: &ldquo;The distinctive qualities which secured a lasting
vogue for the plays of Labiche are to be found in all the comedies
written by him with different collaborators, and are conspicuously
absent from those which they wrote without him.&rdquo; A more
useful and more important collaborator he found in Jean Marie
Michel Geoffroy (1813-1883) whom he had known as a <i>débutant</i>
in his younger days, and who remained his faithful interpreter
to the last. Geoffroy impersonated the <i>bourgeois</i> not only to the
public, but to the author himself; and it may be assumed that
Labiche, when writing, could see and hear Geoffroy acting the
character and uttering, in his pompous, fussy way, the words
that he had just committed to paper. <i>Célimare le bien-aimé</i>
(1863), <i>Le Voyage de M. Perrichon</i> (1860), <i>La Grammaire</i>, <i>Un
Pied dans le crime</i>, <i>La Cagnotte</i> (1864), may be quoted as the
happiest productions of Labiche.</p>

<p>In 1877 he brought his connexion with the stage to a close,
and retired to his rural property in Sologne. There he could be
seen, dressed as a farmer, with low-brimmed hat, thick gaiters
and an enormous stick, superintending the agricultural work
and busily engaged in reclaiming land and marshes. His lifelong
friend, Augier, visited him in his principality, and, being
left alone in the library, took to reading his host&rsquo;s dramatic
productions, scattered here and there in the shape of theatrical
<i>brochures</i>. He strongly advised Labiche to publish a collected
and revised edition of his works. The suggestion, first declined
as a joke and long resisted, was finally accepted and carried
into effect. Labiche&rsquo;s comic plays, in ten volumes, were issued
during 1878 and 1879. The success was even greater than had
been expected by the author&rsquo;s most sanguine friends. It had
been commonly believed that these plays owed their popularity
in great measure to the favourite actors who had appeared in
them; but it was now discovered that all, with the exception
of Geoffroy, had introduced into them a grotesque and caricatural
element, thus hiding from the spectator, in many cases, the true
comic vein and delightful delineation of human character.
The amazement turned into admiration, and the <i>engouement</i>
became so general that very few dared grumble or appear
scandalized when, in 1880, Labiche was elected to the French
Academy. It was fortunate that, in former years, he had never
dreamt of attaining this high distinction; for, as M. Pailleron
justly observed, while trying to get rid of the little faults which
were in him, he would have been in danger of losing some of
his sterling qualities. But when the honour was bestowed upon
him, he enjoyed it with his usual good sense and quiet modesty.
He died in Paris on the 23rd of January 1888.</p>

<p>Some foolish admirers have placed him on a level with Molière,
but it will be enough to say that he was something better than
a public <i>amuseur</i>. Many of his plays have been transferred
to the English stage. They are, on the whole, as sound as they
are entertaining. Love is practically absent from his theatre.
In none of his plays did he ever venture into the depths of
feminine psychology, and womankind is only represented in
them by pretentious old maids and silly, insipid, almost dumb,
young ladies. He ridiculed marriage according to the invariable
custom of French playwrights, but in a friendly and good-natured
manner which always left a door open to repentance
and timely amendment. He is never coarse, never suggestive.
After he died the French farce, which he had raised to something
akin to literature, relapsed into its former grossness and
unmeaning complexity.</p>

he prosecuted Gaius Rabirius (<i>q.v.</i>) for treason; in the same
year, as tribune of the plebs, he carried a plebiscite which indirectly
secured for Caesar the dignity of pontifex maximus
(Dio Cassius xxxvii. 37). He served as a legatus throughout
Caesar&rsquo;s Gallic campaigns and took Caesar&rsquo;s place whenever he
went to Rome. His chief exploits in Gaul were the defeat of
the Treviri under Indutiomarus in 54, his expedition against
Lutetia (Paris) in 52, and his victory over Camulogenus and the
Aedui in the same year. On the outbreak of the civil war,
however, he was one of the first to desert Caesar, probably owing
to an overweening sense of his own importance, not adequately
recognized by Caesar. He was rapturously welcomed on the
Pompeian side; but he brought no great strength with him,
and his ill fortune under Pompey was as marked as his success
had been under Caesar. From the defeat at Pharsalus, to which
he had contributed by affecting to despise his late comrades,
he fled to Corcyra, and thence to Africa. There he was able by
mere force of numbers to inflict a slight check upon Caesar at
Ruspina in 46. After the defeat at Thapsus he joined the younger
Pompey in Spain, and was killed at Munda (March 17th, 45).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABLACHE, LUIGI<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (1794-1858), Franco-Italian singer, was
born at Naples on the 6th of December 1794, the son of a merchant
of Marseilles who had married an Irish lady. In 1806 he entered
the Conservatorio della Pieta de Turchini, where he studied
music under Gentili and singing under Valesi, besides learning
to play the violin and violoncello. As a boy he had a beautiful
alto voice, and by the age of twenty he had developed a magnificent
bass with a compass of two octaves from E&#9837; below to
E&#9837; above the bass stave. After making his first appearance
at Naples he went to Milan in 1817, and subsequently travelled
to Turin, Venice and Vienna. His first appearances in London
and Paris in 1830 led to annual engagements in both the English
and French capitals. His reception at St Petersburg a few years
later was no less enthusiastic. In England he took part in many
provincial musical festivals, and was engaged by Queen Victoria
to teach her singing. On the operatic stage he was equally
successful in comic or tragic parts, and with his wonderfully
powerful voice he could express either humour or pathos. Among
his friends were Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti and Mercadante.
He was one of the thirty-two torch-bearers chosen to surround
the coffin at Beethoven&rsquo;s funeral in 1827. He died at Naples
on the 23rd of January 1858 and was buried at Maison Lafitte,
Paris. Lablache&rsquo;s Leporello in <i>Don Giovanni</i> was perhaps his
most famous impersonation; among his principal other rôles
were Dandini in <i>Cenerentola</i> (Rossini), Assur in <i>Semiramide</i>

<p><span class="bold">LABOUR CHURCH, THE,<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> an organization intended to give
expression to the religion of the labour movement. This
religion is not theological&mdash;it leaves theological questions to
private individual conviction&mdash;but &ldquo;seeks the realization of
universal well-being by the establishment of Socialism&mdash;a
commonwealth founded upon justice and love.&rdquo; It asserts that
&ldquo;improvement of social conditions and the development of
personal character are both essential to emancipation from
social and moral bondage, and to that end insists upon the duty
of studying the economic and moral forces of society.&rdquo; The
first Labour Church was founded at Manchester (England)
in October 1891 by a Unitarian minister, John Trevor. This
has disappeared, but vigorous successors have been established
not only in the neighbourhood, but in Bradford, Birmingham,
Nottingham, London, Wolverhampton and other centres of
industry, about 30 in all, with a membership of 3000. Many
branches of the Independent Labour Party and the Social
Democratic Federation also hold Sunday gatherings for adults
and children, using the Labour Church hymn-book and a similar
form of service, the reading being chosen from Dr Stanton Coit&rsquo;s
<i>Message of Man</i>. There are special forms for child-naming,
marriages and burials. The separate churches are federated
in a Labour Church Union, which holds an annual conference
and business meeting in March. At the conference of 1909,
held in Ashton-under-Lyne, the name &ldquo;Labour Church&rdquo; was
changed to &ldquo;Socialist Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA BOURDONNAIS, BERTRAND FRANÇOIS,<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count Mahé
de</span> (1699-1753), French naval commander, was born at Saint
Malo on the 11th of February 1699. He went to sea when a
boy, and in 1718 entered the service of the French India Company
as a lieutenant. In 1724 he was promoted captain, and displayed
such bravery in the capture of Mahé of the Malabar coast that
the name of the town was added to his own. For two years
he was in the service of the Portuguese viceroy of Goa, but in
1735 he returned to French service as governor of the Île de
France and the Île de Bourbon. His five years&rsquo; administration
of the islands was vigorous and successful. A visit to France
in 1740 was interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities with Great
Britain, and La Bourdonnais was put at the head of a fleet in
Indian waters. He saved Mahé, relieved General Dupleix at
Pondicherry, defeated Lord Peyton, and in 1746 participated
in the siege of Madras. He quarrelled with Dupleix over the
conduct of affairs in India, and his anger was increased on his
return to the Île de France at finding a successor to himself
installed there by his rival. He set sail on a Dutch vessel to
present his case at court, and was captured by the British,
but allowed to return to France on parole. Instead of securing
a settlement of his quarrel with Dupleix, he was arrested (1748)
on a charge of gubernatorial peculation and maladministration,
and secretly imprisoned for over two years in the Bastille.
He was tried in 1751 and acquitted, but his health was
broken by the imprisonment and by chagrin at the loss of
his property. To the last he made unjust accusations against
Dupleix. He died at Paris on the 10th of November 1753.
The French government gave his widow a pension of 2400
livres.</p>

<p>La Bourdonnais wrote <i>Traité de la mâture des vaisseaux</i>
(Paris 1723), and left valuable memoirs which were published
by his grandson, a celebrated chess player, Count L. C. Mahé
de la Bourdonnais (1795-1840) (latest edition, Paris, 1890).
His quarrel with Dupleix has given rise to much debate; for
a long while the fault was generally laid to the arrogance and
jealousy of Dupleix, but W. Cartwright and Colonel Malleson
have pointed out that La Bourdonnais was proud, suspicious
and over-ambitious.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABOUR EXCHANGE,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> a term very frequently applied to
registries having for their principal object the better distribution
of labour (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Unemployment</a></span>). Historically the term is applied
to the system of equitable labour exchanges established in
England between 1832 and 1834 by Robert Owen and his
followers. The idea is said to have originated with Josiah Warren,
who communicated it to Owen. Warren tried an experiment in
1828 at Cincinnati, opening an exchange under the title of a
&ldquo;time store.&rdquo; He joined in starting another at Tuscarawas,
Ohio, and a third at Mount Vernon, Indiana, but none were
quite on the same line as the English exchanges. The fundamental
idea of the English exchanges was to establish a currency
based upon labour; Owen in <i>The Crisis</i> for June 1832 laid down
that all wealth proceeded from labour and knowledge; that
labour and knowledge were generally remunerated according
to the time employed, and that in the new exchanges it was
proposed to make <i>time</i> the standard or measure of wealth.
This new currency was represented by &ldquo;labour notes,&rdquo; the notes
being measured in hours, and the hour reckoned as being worth
sixpence, this figure being taken as the mean between the wage
of the best and the worst paid labour. Goods were then to be
exchanged for the new currency. The exchange was opened
in extensive premises in the Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road, near King&rsquo;s Cross,
London, on the 3rd of September 1832. For some months
the establishment met with considerable success, and a considerable
number of tradesmen agreed to take labour notes in payment
for their goods. At first, an enormous number of deposits was
made, amounting in seventeen weeks to 445,501 hours. But
difficulties soon arose from the lack of sound practical valuators,
and from the inability of the promoters to distinguish between
the labour of the highly skilled and that of the unskilled. Tradesmen,
too, were quick to see that the exchange might be worked
to their advantage; they brought unsaleable stock from
their shops, exchanged it for labour notes, and then picked
out the best of the saleable articles. Consequently the labour
notes began to depreciate; trouble also arose with the proprietors
of the premises, and the experiment came to an untimely
end early in 1834.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABOUR LEGISLATION.<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> Regulation of labour,<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> in some
form or another, whether by custom, royal authority, ecclesiastical
rules or by formal legislation in the interests of a community,
is no doubt as old as the most ancient forms of civilization.
And older than all civilization is the necessity for the
greater part of mankind to labour for maintenance, whether freely
or in bonds, whether for themselves and their families or for the
requirements or superfluities of others. Even while it is clear,
however, that manual labour, or the application of the bodily
forces&mdash;with or without mechanical aid&mdash;to personal maintenance
and the production of goods, remains the common lot of
the majority of citizens of the most developed modern communities,
still there is much risk of confusion if modern technical
terms such as &ldquo;labour,&rdquo; &ldquo;employer,&rdquo; &ldquo;labour legislation&rdquo;
are freely applied to conditions in bygone civilizations with
wholly different industrial organization and social relationships.
In recent times in England there has been a notable disappearance
from current use of correlative terms implying a social relationship
which is greatly changed, for example, in the rapid passage
from the Master and Servant Act 1867 to the Employer and
Workman Act 1875. In the 18th century the term &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo;
passed from its application to a working craftsman
to its modern connotation of at least some command of capital,
the employer being no longer a small working master. An
even more significant later change is seen in the steady development
of a labour legislation, which arose in a clamant social
need for the care of specially helpless &ldquo;protected&rdquo; persons in
factories and mines, into a wider legislation for the promotion
of general industrial health, safety and freedom for the worker
from fraud in making or carrying out wage contracts.</p>

<p>If, then, we can discern these signs of important changes
within so short a period, great caution is needed in rapidly
reviewing long periods of time prior to that industrial revolution
which is traced mainly to the application of mechanical power
to machinery in aid of manual labour, practically begun and
completed within the second half of the 18th century. &ldquo;In
1740 save for the fly-shuttle the loom was as it had been since
weaving had begun ... and the law of the land was&rdquo; (under
the Act of Apprentices of 1503) &ldquo;that wages in each district
should be assessed by Justices of the Peace.&rdquo;<a name="fa2b" id="fa2b" href="#ft2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Turning back
to still earlier times, legislation&mdash;whatever its source or
authority&mdash;must clearly be devoted to aims very different from modern
aims in regulating labour, when it arose before the labourer,
as a man dependent on an &ldquo;employer&rdquo; for the means of doing
work, had appeared, and when migratory labour was almost
unknown through the serfdom of part of the population and the
special status secured in towns to the artisan.</p>

<p>In the great civilizations of antiquity there were great aggregations
of labour which was not solely, though frequently it was
predominantly, slave labour; and some of the features of
manufacture and mining on a great scale arose, producing the
same sort of evils and industrial maladies known and regulated
in our own times. Some of the maladies were described by Pliny
and classed as &ldquo;diseases of slaves.&rdquo; And he gave descriptions
of processes, for example in the metal trades, as belonging entirely
to his own day, which modern archaeological discoveries trace
back through the earliest known Aryan civilizations to a prehistoric
origin in the East, and which have never died out in
western Europe, but can be traced in a concentrated manufacture
with almost unchanged methods, now in France, now
in Germany, now in England.</p>

<p>Little would be gained in such a sketch as this by an endeavour
to piece together the scattered and scanty materials for a comparative
history of the varying conditions and methods of labour
regulation over so enormous a range. While our knowledge
continually increases of the remains of ancient craft, skill and
massed labour, much has yet to be discovered that may throw
light on methods of organization of the labourers. While much,
and in some civilizations most, of the labour was compulsory
or forced, it is clear that too much has been sometimes assumed,
and it is by no means certain that even the pyramids of Egypt,
much less the beautiful earliest Egyptian products in metal
work, weaving and other skilled craft work, were typical
products of slave labour. Even in Rome it was only at times
that the proportion of slaves valued as property was greater
than that of hired workers, or, apart from capture in war or
self-surrender in discharge of a debt, that purchase of slaves
by the trader, manufacturer or agriculturist was generally
considered the cheapest means of securing labour. As in early
England the various stages of village industrial life, medieval
town manufacture, and organization in craft gilds, and the
beginnings of the mercantile system, were parallel with a greater
or less prevalence of serfdom and even with the presence in
part of slavery, so in other ages and civilizations the various
methods of organization of labour are found to some extent
together. The Germans in their primitive settlements were
accustomed to the notion of slavery, and in the decline of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
Roman Empire Roman captives from among the most useful
craftsmen were carried away by their northern conquerors.</p>

<p>The history and present details of the labour laws of various
countries are dealt with below in successive sections: (1) history
of legislation in the United Kingdom; (2) the results as shown
by the law in force in 1909, with the corresponding facts for
(3) Continental Europe and (4) the United States. Under other

subjects.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">I. History in the United Kingdom</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Until the Close of the 15th Century.</i>&mdash;Of the main conditions
of industrial labour in early Anglo-Saxon England details are
scanty. Monastic industrial communities were added in
Christian times to village industrial communities. While
generally husbandry was the first object of toil, and developed
under elaborate regulation in the manorial system, still a considerable
variety of industries grew up, the aim being expressly to
make each social group self-sufficing, and to protect and regulate
village artisans in the interest of village resources. This protective
system, resting on a communal or co-operative view of
labour and social life, has been compared as analogous to the
much later and wider system under which the main purpose
was to keep England as a whole self-sufficing.<a name="fa3b" id="fa3b" href="#ft3b"><span class="sp">3</span></a> It has also been
shown how greatly a fresh spirit of enterprise in industry and
trade was stimulated first by the Danish and next by the Norman
invasion; the former brought in a vigour shown in growth of
villages, increase in number of freemen, and formation of trading
towns; the latter especially opened up new communications
with the most civilized continental people, and was followed
by a considerable immigration of artisans, particularly of
Flemings. In Saxon England slavery in the strictest sense
existed, as is shown in the earliest English laws, but it seems
that the true slave class as distinct from the serf class was comparatively
small, and it may well be that the labour of an
ordinary serf was not practically more severe, and the remuneration
in maintenance and kind not much less than that of agricultural
labourers in recent times. In spite of the steady
protest of the Church, slavery (as the exception, not the general
rule) did not die out for many centuries, and was apt to be
revived as a punishment for criminals, <i>e.g.</i> in the fierce provisions
of the statute of Edward VI. against beggars, not repealed
until 1597. At no time, however, was it general, and as the larger
village and city populations grew the ratio of serfs and slaves
to the freemen in the whole population rapidly diminished,
for the city populations &ldquo;had not the habit and use of slavery,&rdquo;
and while serfs might sometimes find a refuge in the cities from
exceptionally severe taskmasters, &ldquo;there is no doubt that freemen
gradually united with them under the lord&rsquo;s protection,
that strangers engaged in trade sojourned among them, and that
a race of artisans gradually grew up in which original class
feelings were greatly modified.&rdquo; From these conditions grew two
parallel tendencies in regulation of labour. On the one hand
there was, under royal charters, the burgh or municipal organization
and control of artisan and craft labour, passing later into
the more specialized organization in craft gilds; on the other
hand, there was a necessity, sometimes acute, to prevent undue
diminution in the numbers available for husbandry or agricultural
labour. To the latter cause must be traced a provision
appearing in a succession of statutes (see especially an act of
Richard II., 1388), that a child under twelve years once employed
in agriculture might never be transferred to apprenticeship in a
craft. The steady development of England, first as a wool-growing,
later as a cloth-producing country, would accentuate
this difficulty. During the 13th century, side by side with development
of trading companies for the export of wool from
England, may be noted many agreements on the part of monasteries
to sell their wool to Florentines, and during the same
century absorption of alien artisans into the municipal system
was practically completed. Charters of Henry I. provided for
naturalization of these aliens. From the time of Edward I.
to Edward III. a gradual transference of burgh customs, so far
as recognized for the common good, to statute law was in progress,
together with an assertion of the rights of the crown against
ecclesiastical orders. &ldquo;The statutes of Edward I.,&rdquo; says Dr.
Cunningham, &ldquo;mark the first attempt to deal with Industry
and Trade as a public matter which concerns the whole state,
not as the particular affair of leading men in each separate
locality.&rdquo; The first direct legislation for labour by statute,
however, is not earlier than the twenty-third year of the
reign of Edward III., and it arose in an attempt to control the
decay and ruin, both in rural and urban districts, which followed
the Hundred Years&rsquo; War, and the pestilence known as the Black
Death. This first &ldquo;Statute of Labourers&rdquo; was designed for the
benefit of the community, not for the protection of labour or
prevention of oppression, and the policy of enforcing customary
wages and compelling the able-bodied labourer, whether free or
bond, not living in merchandise or exercising any craft, to work
for hire at recognized rates of pay, must be reviewed in the
circumstances and ideals of the time. Regulation generally in
the middle ages aimed at preventing any individual or section
of the community from making what was considered an exceptional
profit through the necessity of others.<a name="fa4b" id="fa4b" href="#ft4b"><span class="sp">4</span></a> The scarcity of
labour by the reduction of the population through pestilence
was not admitted as a justification for the demands for increased
pay, and while the unemployed labourer was liable to be committed
to gaol if he refused service at current rates, the lords of
the towns or manors who promised or paid more to their servants
were liable to be sued treble the sum in question. Similar
restrictions were made applicable to artificers and workmen.
By another statute, two years later, labourers or artificers who
left their work and went into another county were liable to
be arrested by the sheriff and brought back. These and similar
provisions with similar aims were confirmed by statutes of
1360, 1368 and 1388, but the act of 1360, while prohibiting
&ldquo;all alliances and covins of masons, carpenters, congregations,
chapters, ordinances and oaths betwixt them made,&rdquo; allowed
&ldquo;every lord to bargain or covenant for their works in gross
with such labourers and artificers when it pleaseth them, so
that they perform such works well and lawfully according to the
bargain and covenant with them thereof made.&rdquo; Powers were
given by the acts of 1368 and 1388 to justices to determine
matters under these statutes and to fix wages. Records show
that workmen of various descriptions were pressed by writs
addressed to sheriffs to work for their king at wages regardless
of their will as to terms and place of work. These proceedings
were founded on notions of royal prerogative, of which impressment
of seamen survived as an example to a far later date. By
an act of 1388 no servant or labourer, man or woman, however,
could depart out of the hundred to serve elsewhere unless bearing
a letter patent under the king&rsquo;s seal stating the cause of going
and time of return. Such provisions would appear to have
widely failed in their purpose, for an act of 1414 declares that
the servants and labourers fled from county to county, and
justices were empowered to send writs to the sheriffs for fugitive
labourers as for felons, and to examine labourers, servants and
their masters, as well as artificers, and to punish them on confession.
An act of 1405, while putting a property qualification on
apprenticeship and requiring parents under heavy penalties to
put their children to such labour as their estates required, made
a reservation giving freedom to any person &ldquo;to send their
children to school to learn literature.&rdquo; Up to the end of the 15th
century a monotonous succession of statutes strengthening,
modifying, amending the various attempts (since the first
Statute of Labourers) to limit free movement of labour, or
demands by labourers for increased wages, may be seen in the
acts of 1411, 1427, 1444, 1495. It was clearly found extremely
difficult, if not impracticable, to carry out the minute control
of wages considered desirable, and exceptions in favour of certain
occupations were in some of the statutes themselves. In 1512
the penalties for giving wages contrary to law were repealed so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
far as related to masters, but it also appears that London workmen
would not endure the prevalent restrictions as to wages,
and that they secured in practice a greater freedom to arrange
rates when working within the city. Several of these statutes,
and especially one of 1514, fixed the hours of labour when
limiting wages. During March to September the limits were
5 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> to 7 or 8 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, with half an hour off for breakfast and an
hour and a half off for mid-day dinner. In winter the outside
limits were fixed by the length of daylight.</p>

<p>Throughout the 15th century the rapidly increasing manufacture
of cloth was subject to a regulation which aimed at
maintaining the standard of production and prevention of bad
workmanship, and the noteworthy statute 4 Edward IV. c. 1,
while giving power to royal officers to supervise size of cloths,
modes of sealing, &amp;c., also repressed payment to workers in
&ldquo;pins, girdles and unprofitable wares,&rdquo; and ordained payment
in true and lawful money. This statute (the first against
&ldquo;Truck&rdquo;) gives an interesting picture of the way in which
clothiers&mdash;or, as we should call them, wholesale merchants and
manufacturers&mdash;delivered wool to spinners, carders, &amp;c., by
weight, and paid for the work when brought back finished.
It appears that the work was carried on in rural as well as town
districts. While this industry was growing and thriving other
trades remained backward, and agriculture was in a depressed
condition. Craft gilds had primarily the same purpose as the
Edwardian statutes, that is, of securing that the public should
be well served with good wares, and that the trade and manufacture
itself should be on a sound basis as to quality of products
and should flourish. Incidentally there was considerable regulation
by the gilds of the conditions of labour, but not primarily
in the interests of the labourer. Thus night work was prohibited
because it tended to secrecy and so to bad execution of work;
working on holidays was prohibited to secure fair play between
craftsmen and so on. The position of apprentices was made
clear through indentures, but the position of journeymen was
less certain. Signs are not wanting of a struggle between journeymen
and masters, and towards the end of the 15th century
masters themselves, in at least the great wool trade, tended to
develop from craftsmen into something more like the modern
capitalist employer; from an act of 1555 touching weavers
it is quite clear that this development had greatly advanced
and that cloth-making was carried on largely by employers
with large capitals. Before this, however, while a struggle
went on between the town authorities and the craft gilds, journeymen
began to form companies of their own, and the result of
the various conflicts may be seen in an act of Henry VI., providing
that in future new ordinances of gilds shall be submitted to
justices of the peace&mdash;a measure which was strengthened in
1503.</p>

<p>2. <i>From Tudor Days until the Close of the 18th Century.</i>&mdash;A
detailed history of labour regulation in the 16th century would
include some account of the Tudor laws against vagrancy and
methods of dealing with the increase of pauperism, attributable,
at least in part, to the dissolution of the monasteries under
Henry VIII., and to the confiscation of craft gild funds, which
proceeded under Somerset and Edward VI. It is sufficient here
to point to the general recognition of the public right to compel
labourers to work and thus secure control of unemployed as
well as employed. The statutes of Henry VIII. and Edward VI.
against vagrancy differed rather in degree of severity than in
principle from legislation for similar purposes in previous and
subsequent reigns. The Statute of Labourers, passed in the
fifth year of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign (1562), as well as the poor law of
the same year, was to a considerable extent both a consolidating
and an amending code of law, and was so securely based on public
opinion and deeply rooted custom that it was maintained in
force for two centuries. It avowedly approves of principles
and aims in earlier acts, regulating wages, punishing refusal
to work, and preventing free migration of labour. It makes,
however, a great advance in its express aim of protecting the
poor labourer against insufficient wages, and of devising a
machinery, by frequent meeting of justices, which might yield
&ldquo;unto the hired person both in time of scarcity and in time of
plenty a convenient proportion of wages.&rdquo; Minute regulations
were made governing the contract between master and servant,
and their mutual rights and obligations on parallel lines for
(<i>a</i>) artificers, (<i>b</i>) labourers in husbandry. Hiring was to be by
the year, and any unemployed person qualified in either calling
was bound to accept service on pain of imprisonment, if
required, unless possessed of property of a specified amount
or engaged in art, science or letters, or being a &ldquo;gentleman.&rdquo;
Persons leaving a service were bound to obtain a testimonial,
and might not be taken into fresh employment without producing
such testimonial, or, if in a new district, until after showing
it to the authorities of the place. A master might be fined £5,
and a labourer imprisoned, and if contumacious, whipped, for
breach of this rule. The carefully devised scheme for technical
training of apprentices embodied to a considerable extent the
methods and experiences of the craft gilds. Hours of labour
were as follows: &ldquo;All artificers and labourers being hired for
wages by the day or week shall, betwixt the midst of the months
of March and September, be and continue at their work at or
before 5 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and continue at work and not
depart until betwixt 7 and 8 o&rsquo;clock at night, except it be in
the time of breakfast, dinner or drinking, the which time at
the most shall not exceed two hours and a half in a day, that is
to say, at every drinking half an hour, for his dinner one hour
and for his sleep when he is allowed to sleep, the which is from
the midst of May to the midst of August, half an hour; and all
the said artificers and labourers betwixt the midst of September
and the midst of March shall be and continue at their work
from the spring of the day in the morning until the night of the
same day, except it be in time afore appointed for breakfast
and dinner, upon pain to lose and forfeit one penny for every
hour&rsquo;s absence, to be deducted and defaulked out of his wages
that shall so offend.&rdquo; Although the standpoint of the Factory
Act and Truck Act in force at the beginning of the 20th century
as regards hours of labour or regulation of fines deducted from
wages is completely reversed, yet the difference is not great
between the average length of hours of labour permissible under
the present law for women and those hours imposed upon the
adult labourer in Elizabeth&rsquo;s statute. Apart from the standpoint
of compulsory imposition of fines, one advantage in the
definiteness of amount deductable from wages would appear
to lie on the side of the earlier statute.</p>

<p>Three points remain to be touched on in connexion with the
Elizabethan poor law. In addition to (<i>a</i>) consolidation of
measures for setting vagrants to work, we find the first compulsory
contributions from the well-to-do towards poor relief
there provided for, (<i>b</i>) at least a theoretical recognition of a
right as well as an obligation on the part of the labourer to be
hired, (<i>c</i>) careful provision for the apprenticing of destitute
children and orphans to a trade.</p>

<p>One provision of considerable interest arose in Scotland,
which was nearly a century later in organizing provisions for
fixing conditions of hire and wages of workmen, labourers and
servants, similar to those consolidated in the Elizabethan
Statute of Labourers. In 1617 it was provided (and reaffirmed
in 1661) that power should be given to the sheriffs to compel
payment of wages, &ldquo;that servants may be the more willing to
obey the ordinance.&rdquo; The difficulties in regulation of compulsory
labour in Scotland must, however, have been great, for in 1672
houses of correction were erected for disobedient servants, and
masters of these houses were empowered to force them to work
and to correct them according to their demerits. While servants
in manufacture were compelled to work at reasonable rates
they might not enter on a new hire without their previous
master&rsquo;s consent.</p>

<p>Such legislation continued, at least theoretically, in force
until the awakening effected by the beginning of the industrial
revolution&mdash;that is, until the combined effects of steady concentration
of capital in the hands of employers and expansion
of trade, followed closely by an unexampled development of
invention in machinery and application of power to its use.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
completely altered the face of industrial England. From time
to time, in respect of particular trades, provisions against
truck and for payment of wages in current coin, similar to the
act of Edward IV. in the woollen industry, were found necessary,
and this branch of labour legislation developed through the
reigns of Anne and the four Georges until consolidation and
amendment were effected, after the completion of the industrial
revolution, in the Truck Act of 1831. From the close of the
17th century and during the 18th century the legislature is
no longer mainly engaged in devising means for compelling
labourers and artisans to enter into involuntary service, but
rather in regulating the summary powers of justices of the peace
in the matter of dispute between masters and servants in relation
to contracts and agreements, express or implied, presumed to
have been entered into voluntarily on both sides. While the
movement to refer labour questions to the jurisdiction of the
justices thus gradually developed, the main subject matter for
their exercise of jurisdiction in regard to labour also changed,
even when theoretically for a time the two sets of powers&mdash;such
as (<i>a</i>) moderation of craft gild ordinances and punishment of
workers refusing hire, or (<i>b</i>) fixing scales of wages and enforcement
of labour contracts&mdash;might be concurrently exercised.
Even in an act of George II. (1746) for settlement of disputes
and differences as to wages or other conditions under a contract
of labour, power was retained for the justices, on complaint of
the masters of misdemeanour or ill-behaviour on the part of
the servant, to discharge the latter from service or to send him
to a house of correction &ldquo;there to be corrected,&rdquo; that is, to be
held to hard labour for a term not exceeding a month or to be
corrected by whipping. In an act with similar aims of George
IV. (1823), with a rather wider scope, the power to order corporal
punishment, and in 1867 to hard labour, for breach of labour
contracts had disappeared, and soon after the middle of the
19th century the right to enforce contracts of labour also disappeared.
Then breach of such labour contracts became
simply a question of recovery of damages, unless both parties
agreed that security for performance of the contract shall be
given instead of damages.</p>

<p>While the endeavour to enforce labour apart from a contract
died out in the latter end of the 18th century, sentiment for
some time had strongly grown in favour of developing early
industrial training of children. It appears to have been a special
object of charitable and philanthropic endeavour in the 17th
century, as well as the 18th, to found houses of industry, in
which little children, even under five years of age, might be
trained for apprenticeship with employers. Connected as this
development was with poor relief, one of its chief aims was to
prevent future unemployment and vagrancy by training in
habits and knowledge of industry, but not unavowed was
another motive: &ldquo;from children thus trained up to constant
labour we may venture to hope the lowering of its price.&rdquo;<a name="fa5b" id="fa5b" href="#ft5b"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
The evils and excesses which lay enfolded within such a movement
gave the first impulse to the new ventures in labour
legislation which are specially the work of the 19th century.
Evident as it is &ldquo;that before the Industrial Revolution very
young children were largely employed both in their own homes
and as apprentices under the Poor Law,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;long before
Peel&rsquo;s time there were misgivings about the apprenticeship
system,&rdquo; still it needed the concentration and prominence of
suffering and injury to child life in the factory system to lead
to parliamentary intervention.</p>

<p>3. <i>From 1800 to the Codes of 1872 and 1878.</i>&mdash;A serious outbreak
of fever in 1784 in cotton mills near Manchester appears
to have first drawn widespread and influential public opinion
to the overwork of children, under terribly dangerous and
insanitary conditions, on which the factory system was then
largely being carried on. A local inquiry, chiefly by a group
of medical men presided over by Dr Percival, was instituted
by the justices of the peace for Lancashire, and in the forefront
of the resulting report stood a recommendation for limitation
and control of the working hours of the children. A resolution
by the county justices followed, in which they declared their
intention in future to refuse &ldquo;indentures of parish Apprentices
whereby they shall be bound to Owners of Cotton Mills and other
works in which children are obliged to work in the night or more
than ten hours in the day.&rdquo; In 1795 the Manchester Board of
Health was formed, which, with fuller information, more
definitely advised legislation for the regulation of the hours and
conditions of labour in factories. In 1802 the Health and Morals
of Apprentices Act was passed, which in effect formed the first
step towards prevention of injury to and protection of labour
in factories. It was directly aimed only at evils of the apprentice
system, under which large numbers of pauper children were
worked in cotton and woollen mills without education, for
excessive hours, under wretched conditions. It did not apply to
places employing fewer than twenty persons or three apprentices,
and it applied the principle of limitation of hours (to twelve a
day) and abolition of night work, as well as educational requirements,
only to apprentices. Religious teaching and suitable
sleeping accommodation and clothing were provided for in the
act, also as regards apprentices. Lime-washing and ventilation
provisions applied to all cotton and woollen factories employing
more than twenty persons. &ldquo;Visitors&rdquo; were to be appointed
by county justices for repression of contraventions, and were
empowered to &ldquo;direct the adoption of such sanitary regulations
as they might on advice think proper.&rdquo; The mills were to be
registered by the clerk of the peace, and justices had power to
inflict fines of from £2 to £5 for contraventions. Although
enforcement of the very limited provisions of the act was in
many cases poor or non-existent, in some districts excellent
work was done by justices, and in 1803 the West Riding of
Yorkshire justices passed a resolution substituting the ten hours&rsquo;
limit for the twelve hours&rsquo; limit of the act, as a condition of
permission for indenturing of apprentices in mills.</p>

<p>Rapid development of the application of steam power to manufacture
led to growth of employment of children in populous
centres, otherwise than on the apprenticeship system, and before
long the evils attendant on this change brought the general
question of regulation and protection of child labour in textile
factories to the front. The act of 1819, limited as it was, was
a noteworthy step forward, in that it dealt with this wider
scope of employment of children in cotton factories, and it is
satisfactory to record that it was the outcome of the efforts
and practical experiments of a great manufacturer, Robert
Owen. Its provisions fell on every point lower than the aims
he put forward on his own experience as practicable, and notably
in its application only to cotton mills instead of all textile factories.
Prohibition of child labour under nine years of age and limitation
of the working day to twelve in the twenty-four (without
specifying the precise hour of beginning and closing) were the
main provisions of this act. No provision was made for enforcement
of the law beyond such as was attempted in the act of
1802. Slight amendments were attempted in the acts of 1825
and 1831, but the first really important factory act was in 1833
applying to textile factories generally, limiting employment
of young persons under eighteen years of age, as well as children,
prohibiting night work between 8.30 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> and 5.30 <span class="scs">A.M.</span>, and
first providing for &ldquo;inspectors&rdquo; to enforce the law. This is
the act which was based on the devoted efforts of Michael
Sadler, with whose name in this connexion that of Lord Ashley,
afterwards earl of Shaftesbury, was from 1832 associated.
The importance of this act lay in its provision for skilled inspection
and thus for enforcement of the law by an independent
body of men unconnected with the locality in which the manufactures
lay, whose specialization in their work enabled them
to acquire information needed for further development of
legislation for protection of labour. Their powers were to a
certain extent judicial, being assimilated to those possessed
by justices; they could administer oaths and make such &ldquo;rules,
regulations and orders&rdquo; as were necessary for execution of the
act, and could hear complaints and impose penalties under the
act. In 1844 a textile factory act modified these extensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
inspectoral powers, organizing the service on lines resembling
those of our own time, and added provision for certifying
surgeons to examine workers under sixteen years of age as to
physical fitness for employment and to grant certificates of age
and ordinary strength. Hours of labour, by the act of 1833,
were limited for children under eleven to 9 a day or 48 in the
week, and for young persons under eighteen to 12 a day or 69
in the week. Between 1833 and 1844 the movement in favour
of a ten hours&rsquo; day, which had long been in progress, reached
its height in a time of great commercial and industrial distress,
but could not be carried into effect until 1847. By the act of
1844 the hours of adult women were first regulated, and were
limited (as were already those of &ldquo;young persons&rdquo;) to 12 a day;
children were permitted either to work the same hours on alternate
days or &ldquo;half-time,&rdquo; with compulsory school attendance
as a condition of their employment. The aim in thus adjusting
the hours of the three classes of workers was to provide for a
practical standard working-day. For the first time detailed
provisions for health and safety began to make their appearance
in the law. Penal compensation for preventible injuries due to
unfenced machinery was also provided, and appears to have
been the outcome of a discussion by witnesses before the Royal
Commission on Labour of Young Persons in Mines and Manufactures
in 1841.</p>

<p>From this date, 1841, begin the first attempts at protective
legislation for labour in mining. The first Mines Act of 1842
following the terrible revelations of the Royal Commission
referred to excluded women and girls from underground working,
and limited the employment of boys, excluding from underground
working those under ten years, but it was not until 1850 that
systematic reporting of fatal accidents and until 1855 that other
safeguards for health, life and limb in mines were seriously
provided by law. With the exception of regulations against
truck there was no protection for the miner before 1842; before
1814 it was not customary to hold inquests on miners killed
by accidents in mines. From 1842 onwards considerable interaction
in the development of the two sets of acts (mines and
factories), as regards special protection against industrial injury
to health and limb, took place, both in parliament and in the
department (Home Office) administering them. Another
strong influence tending towards ultimate development of
scientific protection of health and life in industry began in the
work and reports of the series of sanitary commissions and Board
of Health reports from 1843 onwards. In 1844 the mines
inspector made his first report, but two years later women were
still employed to some extent underground. Organized inspection
began in 1850, and in 1854 the Select Committee on Accidents
adopted a suggestion of the inspectors for legislative extension
of the practice of several colliery owners in framing special
safety rules for working in mines. The act of 1855 provided
seven general rules, relating to ventilation, fencing of disused
shafts, proper means for signalling, proper gauges and valve
for steam-boiler, indicator and brake for machine lowering and
raising; also it provided that detailed special rules submitted
by mine-owners to the secretary of state, might, on his approval,
have the force of law and be enforceable by penalty. The
Mines Act of 1860, besides extending the law to ironstone
mines, following as it did on a series of disastrous accidents
and explosions, strengthened some of the provisions for safety.
At several inquests strong evidence was given of incompetent
management and neglect of rules, and a demand was made for
enforcing employment only of certificated managers of coal
mines. This was not met until the act of 1872, but in 1860
certain sections relating to wages and education were introduced.
Steady development of the coal industry, increasing association
among miners, and increased scientific knowledge of means of
ventilation and of other methods for securing safety, all paved
the way to the Coal Mines Act of 1872, and in the same year
health and safety in metalliferous mines received their first
legislative treatment in a code of similar scope and character
to that of the Coal Mines Act. This act was amended in 1886,
and repealed and recodified in 1887; its principal provisions
are still in force, with certain revised special rules and modifications
as regards reporting of accidents (1906) and employment
of children (1903). It was based on the recommendations of a
Royal Commission, which had reported in 1864, and which had
shown the grave excess of mortality and sickness among metalliferous
miners, attributed to the inhalation of gritty particles,
imperfect ventilation, great changes of temperature, excessive
physical exertion, exposure to wet, and other causes. The prohibition
of employment of women and of boys under ten years
underground in this class of mines, as well as in coal mines,
had been effected by the act of 1842, and inspection had been
provided for in the act of 1860; these were in amended form
included in the code of 1872, the age of employment of boys
underground being raised to twelve. In the Coal Mines Act
of 1872 we see the first important effort to provide a complete
code of regulation for the special dangers to health, life and
limb in coal mines apart from other mines; it applied to
&ldquo;mines of coal, mines of stratified ironstone, mines of shale and
mines of fire-clay.&rdquo; Unlike the companion act&mdash;applying to
all other mines&mdash;it maintained the age limit of entering underground
employment for boys at ten years, but for those between
ten and twelve it provided for a system of working analogous
to the half-time system in factories, including compulsory school
attendance. The limits of employment for boys from twelve
to sixteen were 10 hours in any one day and 54 in anyone week.
The chief characteristics of the act lay in extension of the
&ldquo;general&rdquo; safety rules, improvement of the method of formulating
&ldquo;special&rdquo; safety rules, provision for certificated and competent
management, and increased inspection. Several important
matters were transferred from the special to the general rules,
such as compulsory use of safety lamps where needed, regulation
of use of explosives, and securing of roofs and sides. Special
rules, before being submitted to the secretary of state for
approval, must be posted in the mine for two weeks, with a
notice that objections might be sent by any person employed
to the district inspector. Wilful neglect of safety provisions
became punishable in the case of employers as well as miners
by imprisonment with hard labour. But the most important
new step lay in the sections relating to daily control and supervision
of every mine by a manager holding a certificate of competency
from the secretary of state, after examination by a
board of examiners appointed by the secretary of state, power
being retained for him to cause later inquiry into competency
of the holder of the certificate, and to cancel or suspend the
certificate in case of proved unfitness.</p>

<p>Returning to the development of factory and workshop law
from the year 1844, the main line of effort&mdash;after the act of
1847 had restricted hours of women and young persons to 10
a day and fixed the daily limits between 6 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> and 6 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>
(Saturday 6 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> to 2 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>)&mdash;lay in bringing trade after trade
in some degree under the scope of this branch of law, which had
hitherto only regulated conditions in textile factories. Bleaching
and dyeing works were included by the acts of 1860 and 1862;
lace factories by that of 1861; calendering and finishing by
acts of 1863 and 1864; bakehouses became partially regulated
by an act of 1863, with special reference to local authorities for
administration of its clauses. The report of the third Children&rsquo;s
Employment Commission brought together in accessible form
the miserable facts relating to child labour in a number of unregulated
industries in the year 1862, and the act of 1864 brought
some of (these earthenware-making, lucifer match-making,
percussion cap and cartridge making, paper-staining, and fustian
cutting) partly under the scope of the various textile factory
acts in force. A larger addition of trades was made three years
later, but the act of 1864 is particularly interesting in that it
first embodied some of the results of inquiries of expert medical
and sanitary commissioners, by requiring ventilation to be
applied to the removal of injurious gases, dust, and other impurities
generated in manufacture, and made a first attempt
to engraft part of the special rules system from the mines acts.
The provisions for framing such rules disappeared in the Consolidating
Act of 1878, to be revived in a better form later.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
The Sanitary Act of 1866, administered by local authorities,
provided for general sanitation in any factories and workshops
not under existing factory acts, and the Workshops Regulation
Act of 1867, similarly to be administered by local authorities,
amended in 1870, practically completed the application of the
main principle of the factory acts to all places in which manual
labour was exercised for gain in the making or finishing of
articles or parts of articles for sale. A few specially dangerous
or injurious trades brought under regulation in 1864 and 1867
(<i>e.g.</i> earthenware and lucifer match making, glass-making)
ranked as &ldquo;factories,&rdquo; although not using mechanical power,
and for a time employment of less than fifty persons relegated
certain workplaces to the category of &ldquo;workshops,&rdquo; but broadly
the presence or absence of such motor power in aid of process
was made and has remained the distinction between factories
and workshops. The Factory Act of 1874, the last of the series
before the great Consolidating Act of 1878, raised the minimum
age of employment for children to ten years in textile factories.
In most of the great inquiries into conditions of child labour
the fact has come clearly to light, in regard to textile and non-textile
trades alike, that parents as much as any employers
have been responsible for too early employment and excessive
hours of employment of children, and from early times until
to-day in factory legislation it has been recognized that they
must to some extent be held responsible for due observation of
the limits imposed. For example, in 1831 it was found necessary
to protect occupiers against parental responsibility for false
certificates of age, and in 1833 parents of a child or &ldquo;any Person
having any benefit from the wages of such child&rdquo; were made
to share responsibility for employment of children without school
attendance or beyond legal hours.</p>

<p>During the discussions on the bill which became law in 1874,
it had become apparent that revision and consolidation of the
multiplicity of statutes then regulating manufacturing industry
had become pressingly necessary; modifications and exceptions
for exceptional conditions in separate industries needed reconsideration
and systematization on clear principles, and the
main requirements of the law could with great advantage be
applied more generally to all the industries. In particular,
the daily limits as to period of employment, pauses for meals,
and holidays, needed to be unified for non-textile factories and
workshops, so as to bring about a standard working-day, and
thus prevent the tendency in &ldquo;the larger establishments to
farm out work among the smaller, where it is done under less
favourable conditions both sanitary and educational.&rdquo;<a name="fa6b" id="fa6b" href="#ft6b"><span class="sp">6</span></a> In
these main directions, and that of simplifying definitions, summarizing
special sanitary provisions that had been gradually
introduced for various trades, and centralizing and improving
the organization of the inspectorate, the Commission of 1876
on the Factory Acts made its recommendations, and the Factory
Act of 1878 took effect. In the fixed working-day, provisions
for pauses, holidays, general and special exceptions, distinctions
between systems of employment for children, young persons
and women, education of children and certificates of fitness for
children and young persons, limited regulation of domestic
workshops, general principles of administration and definitions,
the law of 1878 was made practically the same as that embodied
in the later principal act of 1901. More or less completely revised
are: (<i>a</i>) the sections in the 1878 act relating to mode of controlling
sanitary conditions in workshops (since 1891 primarily
enforced by the local sanitary authority); (<i>b</i>) provision for
reporting accidents and for enforcing safety (other than fencing
of mill gearing and dangerous machinery); (<i>c</i>) detailed regulation
of injurious and dangerous process and trades; (<i>d</i>) powers
of certifying surgeons; (<i>e</i>) amount of overtime permissible
(greatly reduced in amount and now confined to adults); (<i>f</i>)
age for permissible employment of a child has been raised from
ten years to twelve years. Entirely new since the act of 1878
are the provisions: (<i>a</i>) for control of outwork; (<i>b</i>) for supplying
particulars of work and wages to piece-workers, enabling them
to compute the total amount of wages payable to them; (<i>e</i>)
extension of the act to laundries; (<i>f</i>) a tentative effort to limit
the too early employment of mothers after childbirth.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">II. <span class="sc">Law of United Kingdom</span>, 1910</p>

<p><i>Factories and Workshops</i>.&mdash;The act of 1878 remained until
1901, although much had been meanwhile superimposed, a
monument to the efforts of the great factory reformers of the
first half of the 19th century, and the general groundwork of
safety for workers in factories and workshops in the main
divisions of sanitation, security against accidents, physical
fitness of workers, general limitation of hours and times of employment
for young workers and women. The act of 1901, which
came into force 1st January 1902 (and became the principal
act), was an amending as well as a consolidating act. Comparison
of the two acts shows, however, that, in spite of the advantages
of further consolidation and helpful changes in arrangement of
sections and important additions which tend towards a specialized
hygiene for factory life, the fundamental features of the law
as fought out in the 19th century remain undisturbed. So far
as the law has altered in character, it has done so chiefly by
gradual development of certain sanitary features, originally
subordinate, and by strengthening provision for security against
accidents and not by retreat from its earlier aims. At the same
time a basis for possible new developments can be seen in the
protection of &ldquo;outworkers&rdquo; as well as factory workers against
fraudulent or defective particulars of piece-work rates of wages.</p>

<p>Later acts directly and indirectly affecting the law are certain
acts of 1903, 1906, 1907, to be touched on presently.</p>

<p>The act of 1878, in a series of acts from 1883 to 1895, received
striking additions, based (1) on the experience gained in other
branches of protective legislation, <i>e.g.</i> development
of the method of regulation of dangerous trades by
<span class="sidenote">Additions to act of 1878.</span>
&ldquo;special rules&rdquo; and administrative inquiry into
accidents under Coal Mines Acts; (2) on the findings
of royal commissions and parliamentary inquiries, <i>e.g.</i> increased
control of &ldquo;outwork&rdquo; and domestic workshops, and limitation
of &ldquo;overtime&rdquo;; (3) on the development of administrative
machinery for enforcing the more modern law relating to public
health, <i>e.g.</i> transference of administration of sanitary provisions
in workshops to the local sanitary authorities; (4) on the trade-union
demand for means for securing trustworthy records of
wage-contracts between employer and workman, <i>e.g.</i> the section
requiring particulars of work and wages for piece-workers. The
first additions to the act of 1878 were, however, almost purely
attempts to deal more adequately than had been attempted
in the code of 1878 with certain striking instances of trades
injurious to health. Thus the Factory and Workshop Act of
1883 provided that white-lead factories should not be carried
on without a certificate of conformity with certain conditions,
and also made provision for special rules, on lines later superseded
by those laid down in the act of 1891, applicable to any employment
in a factory or workshop certified as dangerous or injurious
by the secretary of state. The act of 1883 also dealt with sanitary
conditions in bakehouses. Certain definitions and explanations
of previous enactments touching overtime and employment
of a child in any factory or workshop were also included in the
act. A class of factories in which excessive heat and humidity
seriously affected the health of operatives was next dealt with
in the Cotton Cloth Factories Act 1889. This provided for
special notice to the chief inspector from all occupiers of cotton
cloth factories (<i>i.e.</i> any room, shed, or workshop or part thereof
in which weaving of cotton cloth is carried on) who intend to
produce humidity by artificial means; regulated both temperature
of workrooms and amount of moisture in the atmosphere,
and provided for tests and records of the same; and fixed a
standard minimum volume of fresh air (600 cub. ft.) to be admitted
in every hour for every person employed in the factory.
Power was retained for the secretary of state to modify by order
the standard for the maximum limit of humidity of the atmosphere
at any given temperature. A short act in 1870 extended
this power to other measures for the protection of health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span></p>

<p>The special measures from 1878 to 1889 gave valuable precedents
for further developments of special hygiene in factory
life, but the next advance in the Factory and Workshop Act
1891, following the House of Lords Committee on the sweating
system and the Berlin International Labour Conference, extended
over much wider ground. Its principal objects were: (<i>a</i>) to
render administration of the law relating to workshops more
efficient, particularly as regards sanitation; with this end in
view it made the primary controlling authority for sanitary
matters in workshops the local sanitary authority (now the
district council), acting by their officers, and giving them the
powers of the less numerous body of factory inspectors, while at
the same time the provisions of the Public Health Acts replaced
in workshops the very similar sanitary provisions of the Factory
Acts; (<i>b</i>) to provide for greater security against accidents and
more efficient fencing of machinery in factories; (<i>c</i>) to extend
the method of regulation of unhealthy or dangerous occupations
by application of special rules and requirements to any incident
of employment (other than in a domestic workshop) certified
by the secretary of state to be dangerous or injurious to health
or dangerous to life or limb; (<i>d</i>) to raise the age of employment
of children and restrict the employment of women immediately
after childbirth; (<i>e</i>) to require particulars of rate of wages to
be given with work to piece-workers in certain branches of the
textile industries; (<i>f</i>) to amend the act of 1878 in various
subsidiary ways, with the view of improving the administration
of its principles, <i>e.g.</i> by increasing the means of checking the
amount of overtime worked, empowering inspectors to enter
workplaces used as dwellings without a justice&rsquo;s warrant, and
the imposition of minimum penalties in certain cases. On this
act followed four years of greatly accelerated administrative
activity. No fewer than sixteen trades were scheduled by the
secretary of state as dangerous to health. The manner of preparing
and establishing suitable rules was greatly modified by
the act of 1901 and will be dealt with in that connexion.</p>

<p>The Factory and Workshop Act 1895 followed thus on a
period of exercise of new powers of administrative regulation
(the period being also that during which the Royal Commission
on Labour made its wide survey of industrial conditions), and
after two successive annual reports of the chief inspector of
factories had embodied reports and recommendations from the
women inspectors, who in 1893 were first added to the inspectorate.
Again, the chief features of an even wider legislative effort
than that of 1891 were the increased stringency and definiteness
of the measures for securing hygienic and safe conditions of work.
Some of these measures, however, involved new principles, as
in the provision for the prohibition of the use of a dangerous
machine or structure by the order of a magistrate&rsquo;s court, and
the power to include in the special rules drawn up in pursuance
of section 8 of the act of 1891, the prohibition of the employment
of any class of persons, or the limitation of the period of employment
of any class of persons in any process scheduled by order
of the secretary of state. These last two powers have both been
exercised, and with the exercise of the latter passed away,
without opposition, the absolute freedom of the employer of
the adult male labourer to carry on his manufacture without
legislative limitation of the hours of labour. Second only in
significance to these new developments was the addition, for
the first time since 1867, of new classes of workplaces not
covered by the general definitions in section 93 of the Consolidating
Act of 1878, viz.: (<i>a</i>) laundries (with special conditions
as to hours, &amp;c.); (<i>b</i>) docks, wharves, quays, warehouses and
premises on which machinery worked by power is temporarily
used for the purpose of the construction of a building or any
structural work in connexion with the building (for the purpose
only of obtaining security against accidents). Other entirely
new provisions in the act of 1895, later strengthened by the act
of 1901, were the requirement of a reasonable temperature in
workrooms, the requirement of lavatories for the use of persons
employed in any department where poisonous substances are
used, the obligation on occupiers and medical practitioners to
report cases of industrial poisoning; and the penalties imposed
on an employer wilfully allowing wearing apparel to be made,
cleaned or repaired in a dwelling-house where an inmate is
suffering from infectious disease. Another provision empowered
the secretary of state to specify classes of outwork and areas
with a view to the regulation of the sanitary condition of premises
in which outworkers are employed. Owing to the conditions
attached to its exercise, no case was found in which this power
could come into operation, and the act of 1901 deals with the
matter on new lines. The requirement of annual returns from
occupiers of persons employed, and the competency of the person
charged with infringing the act to give evidence in his defence,
were important new provisions, as was also the adoption of the
powers to direct a formal investigation of any accident on the
lines laid down in section 45 of the Coal Mines Regulation Act
1887. Other sections, relating to sanitation and safety, were
developments of previous regulations, <i>e.g.</i> the fixing of a standard
of overcrowding, provision of sanitary accommodation separate
for each sex where the standard of the Public Health Act Amendment
Act of 1890 had not been adopted by the competent local
sanitary authority, power to order a fan or other mechanical
means to carry off injurious gas, vapour or other impurity
(the previous power covering only dust). The fencing of
machinery and definition of accidents were made more precise,
young persons were prohibited from cleaning dangerous
machinery, and additional safeguards against risk of injury by
fire or panic were introduced. On the question of employment
the foremost amendments lay in the almost complete prohibition
of overtime for young persons, and the restriction of the power
of an employer to employ protected persons outside his factory
or workshop on the same day that he had employed them in
the factory or workshop. Under the head of particulars of work
and wages to piece-workers an important new power, highly
valued by the workers, was given to apply the principle with
the necessary modifications by order of the secretary of state
to industries other than textile and to outworkers as well as
to those employed inside factories and workshops.</p>

<p>In 1899 an indirect modification of the limitation to employment
of children was effected by the Elementary Education
Amendment Act, which, by raising from eleven to
twelve the minimum age at which a child may, by
<span class="sidenote">The act of 1901.</span>
the by-laws of a local authority, obtain total or
partial exemption from the obligation to attend school, made it
unlawful for an occupier to take into employment any child
under twelve in such a manner as to prevent full-time attendance
at school. The age of employment became generally thereby
the same as it has been for employment at a mine above ground
since 1887. The act of 1901 made the prohibition of employment
of a child under twelve in a factory or workshop direct
and absolute. Under the divisions of sanitation, safety, fitness
for employment, special regulation of dangerous trades, special
control of bakehouses, exceptional treatment of creameries, new
methods of dealing with home work and outworkers, important
additions were made to the general law by the act of 1901, as
also in regulations for strengthened administrative control.
New general sanitary provisions were those prescribing: (<i>a</i>)
ventilation <i>per se</i> for every workroom, and empowering the
secretary of state to fix a standard of sufficient ventilation;
(<i>b</i>) drainage of wet floors; (<i>c</i>) the power of the secretary of
state to define in certain cases what shall constitute sufficient
and suitable sanitary accommodation. New safety provisions
were those relating to&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Examination and report on steam
boilers; (<i>b</i>) prohibition of employment of a child in cleaning
below machinery in motion; (<i>c</i>) power of the district council
to make by-laws for escape in case of fire. The most important
administrative alterations were: (<i>a</i>) a justice engaged in the
same trade as, or being officer of an association of persons
engaged in the same trade as, a person charged with an offence
may not act at the hearing and determination of the charge;
(<i>b</i>) ordinary supervision of sanitary conditions under which
outwork is carried on was transferred to the district council,
power being reserved to the Home Office to intervene in case of
neglect or default by any district council.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span></p>

<p>The Employment of Children Act 1903, while primarily
providing for industries outside the scope of the Factory Act,
incidentally secured that children employed as half-timers
should not also be employed in other occupations.
<span class="sidenote">Acts of 1903, 1906, 1907.</span>
The Notice of Accidents Act 1906 amended
the whole system of notification of accidents, simultaneously
in mines, quarries, factories and workshops, and
will be set out in following paragraphs. The Factory and
Workshop Act of 1907 amended the law in respect of laundries
by generally applying the provisions of 1901 to trade laundries
while granting them choice of new exceptional periods, and by
extending the provisions of the act (with certain powers to the
Home Office by Orders laid before parliament to allow variations)
to institution laundries carried on for charitable or reformatory
purposes. The Employment of Women Act 1907 repealed
an exemption in the act of 1901 (and earlier acts) relating to
employment of women in flax scutch mills, thus bringing this
employment under the ordinary provisions as to period of
employment.</p>

<p>The following paragraphs aim at presenting an idea of the
scope of the modified and amended law, as a whole, adding
where clearly necessary reference to the effect of acts, which
ceased to apply after the 31st of December 1901:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The workplaces to which the act applies are, first, &ldquo;factories&rdquo;
and &ldquo;workshops&rdquo;; secondly, laundries, docks, wharves, &amp;c.,
enumerated above as introduced and regulated partially
only by the act of 1895 and subsequent acts. Apart from
<span class="sidenote">Definitions.</span>
this secondary list, and having regard to workplaces
which remain undefined by the law, the act may broadly be said to
apply to premises, rooms or places in which manual labour, with or
without the aid of mechanical power, is exercised for gain in or
incidental to the making, altering, repairing, ornamenting, washing,
cleaning or finishing or adapting for sale of any article or part of any
article. If steam, water or other mechanical power is used in aid of
the manufacturing process, the workplace is a factory; if not, it is
a workshop. There is, however, a list of eighteen classes of works
(brought under the factory law for reasons of safety, &amp;c., before
workshops generally were regulated) which are defined as factories
whether power is used in them or not. Factories are, again, subdivided
into textile and non-textile: they are textile if the machinery
is employed in preparing, manufacturing or finishing cotton, wool,
hair, silk, flax, hemp, jute, tow, China grass, cocoanut fibre or other
like material either separately or mixed together, or mixed with any
other material, or any fabric made thereof; all other factories are
non-textile. The distinction turns on the historical origin of factory
regulation and the regulations in textile factories remain in some
respects slightly more stringent than in the non-textile factories
and workshops, though the general provisions are almost the same.
Three special classes of workshops have for certain purposes to be
distinguished from ordinary workshops, which include tenement
workshops: (<i>a</i>) Domestic workshops, <i>i.e.</i> any private house, room or
place, which, though used as a dwelling, is by reason of the work
carried on there a workshop, and in which the only persons employed
are members of the same family, dwelling there alone&mdash;in these
women&rsquo;s hours are unrestricted; (<i>b</i>) Women&rsquo;s workshops, in which
neither children nor young persons are employed&mdash;in these a more
elastic arrangement of hours is permissible than in ordinary workshops;
(<i>c</i>) Workshops in which men only are employed&mdash;these come
under the same general regulations in regard to sanitation as other
workshops, also under the provisions of the Factory Act as regards
security, and, if certified by the secretary of state, may be brought
under special regulations. They are otherwise outside the scope of
the act of 1901.</p>

<p>The person to whom the regulations apply in the above-defined
workplaces are <i>children</i>, <i>i.e.</i> persons between the ages of twelve and
fourteen, <i>young persons</i>, <i>i.e.</i> boys or girls between the ages of fourteen
(or if an educational certificate has been obtained, thirteen) and
eighteen years of age, and <i>women</i>, <i>i.e.</i> females above the age of
eighteen; these are all &ldquo;protected&rdquo; persons to whom the general
provisions of the act, inclusive of the regulation of hours and times
of employment, apply. To adult men generally those provisions
broadly only apply which are aimed at securing sanitation and
safety in the conduct of the manufacturing process.</p>

<p>The person generally responsible for observance of the provisions
of the law, whether these relate to health, safety, limitation of
the hours of labour or other matters, is the <i>occupier</i> (a term undefined
in the act) of the factory, workshop or laundry. There are,
however, limits to his responsibility: (<i>a</i>) generally, where the
occupier has used due diligence to enforce the execution of the act,
and can show that another person, whether agent, servant, workman
or other person, is the real offender; (<i>b</i>) specially in a factory the
sections relating to employment of protected persons, where the
owner or hirer of a machine or implement driven by mechanical
power is some person other than the occupier of the factory, the
owner or hirer, so far as respects any offence against the act committed
in relation to a person who is employed in connexion with the
machine or implement, and is in the employment or pay of the
owner or hirer, shall be deemed to be the occupier of the factory;
(<i>c</i>) for the one purpose of reporting accidents, the actual employer
of the person injured in any factory or workshop is bound under
penalty immediately to report the same to the occupier; (<i>d</i>) so far
as relates to sanitary conditions, fencing of machinery, affixing of
notices in <i>tenement</i> factories, the <i>owner</i> (as defined by the Public
Health Act 1875), generally speaking, takes the place of the occupier.</p>

<p>Employment in a factory or workshop includes work whether for
wages or not: (<i>a</i>) in a manufacturing process or handicraft, (<i>b</i>) in
cleaning any place used for the same, (<i>c</i>) in cleaning or oiling any part
of the machinery, (<i>d</i>) any work whatsoever incidental to the process
or handicraft, or connected with the article made. Persons found in
any part of the factory or workshop, where machinery is used or
manufacture carried on, except at meal-times, or when machinery
is stopped, are deemed to be employed until the contrary is proved.
The act, however, does not apply to employment for the sole purpose
of repairing the premises or machinery, nor to the process of preserving
and curing fish immediately upon its arrival in the fishing
boats in order to prevent the fish from being destroyed or spoiled,
nor to the process of cleaning and preparing fruit so far as is necessary
to prevent it from spoiling during the months of June, July, August
and September. Certain light handicrafts carried on by a family
only in a private house or room at irregular intervals are also outside
the scope of the act.</p>

<p>The foremost provisions are those relating to the sanitary condition
of the workplaces and the general security of every class of
worker. Every factory must be kept in a cleanly condition,
free from noxious effluvia, ventilated in such a
<span class="sidenote">Sanitation.</span>
manner as to render harmless, so far as practicable, gases,
vapours, dust or other impurities generated in the manufacture; must
be provided with sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences separate
for the sexes; must not be overcrowded (not less than 250 cubic ft.
during the day, 400 during overtime, for each worker). In these
matters the law of public health takes in workshops the place of the
Factory Act, the requirements being substantially the same.
Although, however, primarily the officers of the district council
enforce the sanitary provisions in workshops, the government factory
inspectors may give notice of any defect in them to the district
council in whose district they are situate; and if proceedings are not
taken within one month by the latter, the factory inspector may act
in default and recover expenses from the district council. This power
does not extend to domestic workshops which are under the law
relating to public health so far as general sanitation is concerned.
General powers are reserved to the secretary of state, where he
is satisfied that the Factory Act or law relating to public health
as regards workplaces has not been carried out by any district
council, to authorize a factory inspector during a period named in
his order to act instead of the district council. Other general sanitary
provisions administered by the government inspectors are the requirement
in factories and workshops of washing conveniences where
poisonous substances are used; adequate measures for securing and
maintaining a reasonable temperature of such a kind as will not
interfere with the purity of the air in each room in which any person
is employed; maintenance of sufficient means of ventilation in every
room in a factory or workshop (in conformity with such standard as
may be prescribed by order of the secretary of state); provision of a
fan to carry off injurious dust, gas or other impurity, and prevent
their inhalation in any factory or workshop; drainage of floors
where wet processes are carried on. For laundries and bakehouses
there are further sanitary regulations; <i>e.g.</i> in laundries all stoves for
heating irons shall be sufficiently separated from any ironing-room
or ironing-table, and the floors shall be &ldquo;drained in such a manner
as will allow the water to flow off freely&rdquo;; and in bakehouses a
cistern supplying water to a bakehouse must be quite separate from
that supplying water to a water-closet, and the latter may not
communicate directly with the bakehouse. Use of underground
bakehouses (<i>i.e.</i> a baking room with floor more than 3 ft. below the
ground adjoining) is prohibited, except where already used at the
passing of the act; further, in these cases, after 1st January 1904,
a certificate as to suitability in light, ventilation, &amp;c., must be obtained
from the district council. In other trades certified by the
secretary of state further sanitary regulations may be made to increase
security for health by special rules to be presently touched on. The
secretary of state may also make sanitary requirements a condition
of granting such exceptions to the general law as he is empowered to
grant. In factories, as distinct from workshops, a periodical lime
washing (or washing with hot water and soap where paint and
varnish have been used) of all inside walls and ceilings once at least
in every fourteen months is generally required (in bakehouses once
in six months). As regards sufficiency and suitability of sanitary
accommodation, the standards determined by order of the secretary
of state shall be observed in the districts to which it is made applicable.
An order was made called the Sanitary Accommodation Order,
on the 4th of February 1903, the definitions and standards in which
have also been widely adopted by local sanitary authorities in
districts where the Order itself has no legal force, the local authority
having parallel power under the Public Health Act of 1890.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span></p>

<p>Security in the use of machinery is provided for by precautions
as regards the cleaning of machinery in motion and working between
the fixed and traversing parts of self-acting machines
driven by power, by fencing of machinery, and by empowering
<span class="sidenote">Security and accidents.</span>
inspectors to obtain an order from a court of
summary jurisdiction to prohibit the use, temporarily or
absolutely, of machinery, ways, works or plant, including use of a
steam boiler, which cannot be used without danger to life and
limb. Every hoist and fly-wheel directly connected with mechanical
power, and every part of a water-wheel or engine worked by
mechanical power, and every wheel race, must be fenced, whatever
its position, and every part of mill-gearing or dangerous machinery
must either be fenced or be in such position that it is as safe as if
fenced. No protected persons may clean any part of mill-gearing in
motion, and children may further not clean any part of or below
manufacturing machinery in motion by aid of mechanical power;
young persons further may not clean any machinery if the inspector
notifies it to the occupier as dangerous. Security as regards the use
of dangerous premises is provided for by empowering courts of
summary jurisdiction, on the application of an inspector, to prohibit
their use until the danger has been removed. The district council, or,
in London, the county council, or in case of their default the factory
inspector, can require certain provisions for escape in case of fire in
factories and workshops in which more than forty persons are employed;
special powers to make by-laws for means of escape from
fire in any factory or workshop are, in addition to any powers for
prevention of fire that they possess, given to every district council,
in London to the county council. The means of escape must be kept
free from obstruction. Provisions are made for doors to open outwards
in each room in which more than ten persons are employed, and
to prevent the locking, bolting or fastening of doors so that they
cannot easily be opened from inside when any person is employed or
at meals inside the workplace. Further, provisions for security may
be provided in special regulations. Every boiler for generating
steam in a factory or workshop or place where the act applies must
have a proper safety valve, a steam gauge, and a water gauge, and
every such boiler, valve and gauge must be maintained in proper
condition. Examination by a competent person must take place
at least once in every fourteen months. The occupier of any factory
or workshop may be liable for penal compensation not exceeding £100
in case of injury or death due to neglect of any provision or special
rule, the whole or any part of which may be applied for the benefit
of the injured person or his family, as the secretary of state determines.
When a death has occurred by accident in a factory or
workshop, the coroner must advise the factory inspector for the
district of the place and time of the inquest. The secretary of state
may order a formal investigation of the circumstances of any accident
as in the case of mines. Careful and detailed provisions are made for
the reporting by occupiers to inspectors, and entry in the registers
at factories and workshops of accidents which occur in a factory or
workshop and (<i>a</i>) cause loss of life to a person employed there, or (<i>b</i>)
are due to machinery moved by mechanical power, molten metal,
hot liquid, explosion, escape of gas or steam, electricity, so disabling
any person employed in the factory or workshop as to cause him to
be absent throughout at least one whole day from his ordinary work,
(<i>c</i>) are due to any other special cause which the secretary of state may
determine, (<i>d</i>) not falling under the previous heads and yet cause
disablement for more than seven days&rsquo; ordinary work to any person
working in the factory or workshop. In the case of (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) notice
has also to be sent to the certifying surgeon by the occupier. Cases
of lead, phosphorus, arsenical and mercurial poisoning, or anthrax,
contracted in any factory or workshop must similarly be reported
and registered by the occupier, and the duty of reporting these cases
is also laid on medical practitioners under whose observation they
come. The list of classes of poisoning can be extended by the
secretary of state&rsquo;s order.</p>

<p>Certificates of physical fitness for employment must be obtained
by the occupier from the certifying surgeon for the district for all
persons under sixteen years of age employed in a factory,
and in any class of workshops to which the requirement
<span class="sidenote">Physical fitness of workers.</span>
has been extended by order of the secretary of state, and
an inspector may suspend any such persons for re-examination
in a factory, or for examination in a workshop, when
&ldquo;disease or bodily infirmity&rdquo; unfits the person, in his opinion, for
the work of the place. The certifying surgeon may examine the
process as well as the person submitted, and may qualify the certificate
he grants by conditions as to the work on which the person is fit
to be employed. An occupier of a factory or workshop or laundry
shall not knowingly allow a woman to be employed therein within
four weeks after childbirth.</p>

<p>The employment of children, young persons and women is regulated
as regards ordinary and exceptional hours of work, ordinary
and exceptional meal-times, length of spells and holidays.
The outside limits of ordinary periods of employment and
<span class="sidenote">Hours of protected persons.</span>
holidays are, broadly, the same for textile factories as for
non-textile factories and workshops; the main difference
lies in the requirement of not less than a total two hours&rsquo; interval for
meals out of the twelve, and a limit of four and a half hours for any
spell of work, a longer weekly half holiday, and a prohibition of
overtime, in textile factories, as compared with a total one and a half
hours&rsquo; interval for meals and a limit of five hours for spells and
(conditional) permission of overtime in non-textile factories. The
hours of work must be specified, and from Monday to Friday may be
between 6 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> and 6 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, or 7 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> to 7 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>; in non-textile factories
and workshops the hours also may be taken between 8 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> and 8 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>
or by order of the secretary of state for special industries 9 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> to
9 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> Between these outside limits, with the proviso that meal-times
must be fixed and limits as to spells observed, women and
young persons may be employed the full time, children on the
contrary only half time, on alternate days, or in alternate sets
attending school half time regularly. On Saturdays, in textile
factories in which the period commences at 6 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> all manufacturing
work must cease at 12 if not less than one hour is given for meals,
or 11.30 if less than one hour is given for meals (half an hour extra
allowed for cleaning), and in non-textile factories and workshops
at 2 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, 3 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> or 4 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, according as the hour of beginning is 6 <span class="scs">A.M.</span>,
7 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> or 8 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> In &ldquo;domestic workshops&rdquo; the total number of hours
for young persons and children must not exceed those allowed in
ordinary workshops, but the outside limits for beginning and ending
are wider; and the case is similar as regards hours of women in
&ldquo;women&rsquo;s workshops.&rdquo; Employment outside a factory or workshop
in the business of the same is limited in a manner similar to that laid
down in the Shop Hours Act, to be touched on presently. Overtime
in certain classes of factories, workshops and warehouses attached
to them is permitted, under conditions specified in the acts, for
women, to meet seasonal or unforeseen pressure of business, or
where goods of a perishable nature are dealt with, for young persons
only in a very limited degree in factories liable to stoppage for
drought or flood, or for an unfinished process. These and other
cases of exceptional working are under minute and careful administrative
regulations. Broadly these same regulations as to exceptional
overtime may apply in <i>laundries</i> but the act of 1907 granted to
laundries not merely ancillary to the manufacture carried on in a
factory or workshop (<i>e.g.</i> shirt and collar factories), additional power
to fix different periods of employment for different days of the week,
and to make use of one or other of two exceptional methods of
arranging the daily periods so as to permit of periods of different
length on different days; these exceptional periods cannot be
worked in addition to overtime permissible under the general law.
Laundries carried on in connexion with charitable or reformatory
institutions were brought in 1907 within the scope of the law, but
special schemes for regulation as to hours, meals, holidays, &amp;c., may
be submitted by the managers to the secretary of state, who is empowered
to approve them if he is satisfied that they are not less
favourable than the corresponding provisions of the principal act;
such schemes shall be laid as soon as possible before both Houses of
Parliament.</p>

<p>Night work is allowed in certain specified industries, under conditions,
for male young persons, but for no other workers under
eighteen, and overtime for women may never be later than
10 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> or before 6 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> Sunday work is prohibited except,
<span class="sidenote">Dangerous and unhealthy industries.</span>
under conditions, for Jews; and in factories, workshops
and laundries six holidays (generally the Bank holidays)
must be allowed in the year. In creameries in which
women and young persons are employed the secretary of state may
by special order vary the beginning and end of the daily period of
employment, and allow employment for not more than three hours
on Sundays and holidays.</p>

<p>The general provisions of the act may be supplemented where
specially dangerous or unhealthy trades are carried on, by special
regulations. This was provided for in the law in force until 31st
December 1901, as in the existing principal act, and the power to
establish rules had been exercised between 1892 and 1901 in twenty-two
trades or processes where injury arose either from handling of
dangerous substances, such as lead and lead compounds, phosphorus,
arsenic or various chemicals, or where there is inhalation of irritant
dust or noxious fumes, or where there is danger of explosion or infection
of anthrax. Before the rule could be drawn up under the acts
of 1891 to 1895, the secretary of state had to certify that in the particular
case or class of cases in question (<i>e.g.</i> process or machinery),
there was, in his opinion, danger to life or limb or risk of injury to
health; thereupon the chief inspector might propose to the occupier
of the factory or workshop such special rules or measures as he thought
necessary to meet the circumstances. The occupier might object
or propose modifications, but if he did not the rules became binding
in twenty-one days; if he objected, and the secretary of state did not
assent to any proposed modification, the matters in difference had
to be referred to arbitration, the award in which finally settled the
rules or requirement to be observed. In November 1901, in the case
of the earthenware and china industry, the last arbitration of the
kind was opened and was finally concluded in 1903. The parties to
the arbitration were the chief inspector, on behalf of the secretary of
state, and the occupier or occupiers, but the workmen interested
might be and were represented on the arbitration. In the establishing
of the twenty-two sets of existing special rules only thrice has
arbitration been resorted to, and only on two of these occasions
were workmen represented. The provisions as to the arbitration
were laid down in the first schedule to the Act of 1891, and were
similar to those under the Coal Mines Regulation Acts. Many of
these codes have still the force of law and will continue until in due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
course revised under the amended procedure of the act of 1901.
They might not only regulate conditions of employment, but also
restrict or prohibit employment of any class of workers; where
such restriction or prohibition affected adult workers the rules had to
be laid for forty days before both Houses of Parliament before
coming into operation. The obligation to observe the rules in
detail lies on workers as well as on occupiers, and the section in
the act of 1891 providing a penalty for non-observance was drafted,
as in the case of the mines, so as to provide for a simultaneous fine
for each (not exceeding two pounds for the worker, not exceeding ten
pounds for the employer).</p>

<p>The provisions as to special regulations of the act of 1901 touch
primarily the method of procedure for making the regulations, but
they also covered for the first time domestic workshops and added a
power as to the kind of regulations that may be made; further,
they strengthened the sanction for observance of any rules that may
be established, by placing the occupier in the same general position
as regards penalty for non-observance as in other matters under the
act. On the certificate of the secretary of state that any manufacture,
machinery, plant, process or manual labour used in factories
or workshops is dangerous or injurious to life, health or limb, such
regulations as appear to the secretary of state to meet the necessity
of the case may be made by him after he has duly published notice:
(1) of his intention; (2) of the place where copies of the draft regulations
can be obtained; and (3) of the time during which objections
to them can be made by persons affected. The secretary of state
may modify the regulations to meet the objections made. If not,
unless the objection is withdrawn or appears to him frivolous, he
shall, before making the regulations, appoint a competent person to
hold a public inquiry with regard to the draft regulations and to
report to him thereon. The inquiry is to be made under such rules
as the secretary of state may lay down, and when the regulations are
made, they must be laid as soon as possible before parliament. Either
House may annul these regulations or any of them, without prejudice
to the power of the secretary of state to make new regulations.
The regulations may apply to all factories or workshops in which the
certified manufacture, process, &amp;c., is used, or to a specified class.
They may, among other things, (<i>a</i>) prohibit or limit employment
of any person or class of persons; (<i>b</i>) prohibit, limit, or control use
of any material or process; (<i>c</i>) modify or extend special regulations
contained in the Act. Regulations have been established among
others in the following trades and processes: felt hat-making where
any inflammable solvent is used; file-cutting by hand; manufacture
of electric accumulators; docks, processes of loading, unloading,
&amp;c.; tar distilling; factories in which self-acting mules are
used; use of locomotives; spinning and weaving of flax, hemp and
jute; manufacture of paints and colours; heading of yarn dyed by
means of lead compounds.</p>

<p>Although the Factory and Workshop Acts have not directly
regulated wages, they have made certain provision for securing to
the worker that the amount agreed upon shall be received:
(<i>a</i>) by extending every act in force relating to the inspection
<span class="sidenote">Measures and particulars to piece-workers.</span>
of weights, measures and weighing machines for use
in the sale of goods to those used in a factory or workshop
for checking or ascertaining the wages of persons employed;
(<i>b</i>) by ensuring that piece-workers in the textile
trades (and other trades specified by the secretary of state) shall
receive, before commencing any piece of work, clear particulars of
the wages applicable to the work to be done and of the work to which
that rate is to be applied. Unless the particulars of work are ascertainable
by an automatic indicator, they must be given to textile
workers in writing, and in the case of weavers in the cotton, worsted
and woollen trades the particulars of wages must be supplied
separately to each worker, and also shown on a placard in a conspicuous
position. In other textile processes, it is sufficient to
furnish the particulars separately to each worker. The secretary of
state has used his powers to extend this protection to non-textile
workers, with suitable modifications, in various hardware industries,
including pen-making, locks, chains, in wholesale tailoring and
making of wearing apparel, in fustian cutting, umbrella-making,
brush-making and a number of other piece-work trades. He
further has in most of these and other trades used his power to extend
this protection to outworkers.</p>

<p>With a view to efficient administration of the act (<i>a</i>) certain
notices have to be conspicuously exhibited at the factory or workshop,
(<i>b</i>) registers and lists kept, and (<i>c</i>) notices sent
to the inspector by the occupier. Among the first the
<span class="sidenote">Administration.</span>
most important are the prescribed abstract of the act,
the names and addresses of the inspector and certifying surgeon,
the period of employment, and specified meal-times (which may not
be changed without fresh notice to the inspector), the air space and
number of persons who may legally be employed in each room, and
prescribed particulars of exceptional employment; among the
second are the general registers of children and young persons employed,
of accidents, of lime-washing, of overtime, and lists of outworkers;
among the third are the notice of beginning to occupy a
factory or workshop, which the occupier must send within one
month, report of overtime employment, notice of accident, poisoning
or anthrax, and returns of persons employed, with such other particulars
as may be prescribed. These must be sent to the chief
inspector at intervals of not less than one and not more than three
years, as may be directed by the secretary of state.</p>

<p>The secretary of state for the Home Department controls the
administration of the acts, appoints the inspectors referred to in
the acts, assigns to them their duties, and regulates the manner and
cases in which they are to exercise the powers of inspectors. The
act, however, expressly assigns certain duties and powers to a chief
inspector and certain to district inspectors. Many provisions of the
acts depend as to their operation on the making of orders by the
secretary of state. These orders may impose special obligations
on occupiers and increase the stringency of regulations, may apply
exceptions as to employment, and may modify or relax regulations
to meet special classes of circumstances. In certain cases, already
indicated, his orders guide or determine the action of district councils,
and, generally, in case of default by a council he may empower his
inspectors to act as regards workplaces, instead of the council, both
under the Factory Acts and Public Health Acts.</p>

<p>The powers of an inspector are to enter, inspect and examine, by
day or by night, at any reasonable time, any factory or workshop
(or laundry, dock, &amp;c.), or part of one, when he has reason to believe
that any person is employed there; to take with him a constable if
he has reasonable cause to expect obstruction; to require production
of registers, certificates, &amp;c., under the acts; to examine, alone or
in the presence of any other person, as he sees fit, every person in the
factory or workshop, or in a school where the children employed are
being educated; to prosecute, conduct or defend before a court of
summary jurisdiction any proceeding under the acts; and to exercise
such other powers as are necessary for carrying the act into effect.
The inspector has also the duty of enforcing the Truck Acts in places,
and in respect of persons, under the Factory Acts. Certifying
surgeons are appointed by the chief inspector subject to the regulations
of the secretary of state, and their chief duties are (<i>a</i>) to examine
workers under sixteen, and persons under special rules, as to physical
fitness for the daily work during legal periods, with power to grant
qualified certificates as to the work for which the young worker is fit,
and (<i>b</i>) to investigate and report on accidents and cases of lead,
phosphorus or other poisoning and anthrax.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1907 there were registered as under inspection 110,276
factories, including laundries with power, 146,917 workshops
(other than men&rsquo;s workshops), including laundries without
power; of works under special rules or regulations (included
in the figures just given) there were 10,586 and 19,687 non-textile
works under orders for supply of particulars to piece-workers.
Of notices of accidents received there were 124,325,
of which 1179 were fatal; of reported cases of poisoning there
were 653, of which 40 were fatal. Prosecutions were taken by
inspectors in 4474 cases and convictions obtained in 4211 cases.
Of persons employed there were, according to returns of occupiers,
1904, 4,165,791 in factories and 688,756 in workshops.</p>

<p><i>Coal Mines</i>.&mdash;The mode of progress to be recorded in the
regulation of coal mines since 1872 can be contrasted in one
aspect with the progress just recorded of factory legislation
since 1878. Consolidation was again earlier adopted when
large amendments were found necessary, with the result that
by far the greater part of the law is to be found in the act of
1887, which repealed and re-enacted, with amendments, the
Coal Mines Acts of 1872 and 1886, and the Stratified Ironstone
Mines (Gunpowder) Act, 1881. The act of 1881 was simply
concerned with rules relating to the use of explosives underground.
The act of 1886 dealt with three questions: (<i>a</i>) The election
and payment of checkweighers (<i>i.e.</i> the persons appointed and
paid by miners in pursuance of section 13 of the act of 1887 for
the purpose of taking a correct account on their behalf of the
weight of the mineral gotten by them, and for the correct
determination of certain deductions for which they may be liable);
(<i>b</i>) provision for new powers of the secretary of state to direct
a formal investigation of any explosion or accident, and its causes
and circumstances, a provision which was later adopted in the
law relating to factories; (<i>c</i>) provision enabling any relatives
of persons whose death may have been caused by explosions
or accidents in or about mines to attend in person, or by agent,
coroners&rsquo; inquests thereon, and to examine witnesses. The act
of 1887, which amended, strengthened and consolidated these
acts and the earlier Consolidating Act of 1872, may also be
contrasted in another aspect with the general acts of factory
legislation. In scope it formed, as its principal forerunner had
done, a general code; and in some measure it went farther in
the way of consolidation than the Factory Acts had done,
inasmuch as certain questions, which in factories are dealt with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>
by statutes distinct from the Factory Acts, have been included
in the Mines Regulation Acts, <i>e.g.</i> the prohibition of the payment
of wages in public-houses, and the machinery relating to weights
and measures whereby miners control their payment; further,
partly from the less changing nature of the industry, but probably
mainly from the power of expression gained for miners by their
organization, the code, so far as it went, at each stage answered
apparently on the whole more nearly to the views and needs of
the persons protected than the parallel law relating to factories.
This was strikingly seen in the evidence before the Royal Commission
on Labour in 1892-1894, where the repeated expression
of satisfaction on the part of the miners with the provisions
as distinct from the administration of the code (&ldquo;with a few
trifling exceptions&rdquo;) is in marked contrast with the long and
varied series of claims and contentions put forward for amendment
of the Factory Acts.</p>

<p>Since the act of 1887 there have followed five minor acts,
based on the recommendation of the officials acting under the
acts, while two of them give effect to claims made by the miners
before the Royal Commission on Labour. Thus, in 1894, the
Coal Mines (Checkweigher) Act rendered it illegal for an employer
(&ldquo;owner, agent, or manager of any mine, or any person employed
by or acting under the instructions of any such owner, agent,
or manager&rdquo;) to make the removal of a particular checkweigher
a condition of employment, or to exercise improper influence
in the appointment of a checkweigher. The need for this
provision was demonstrated by a decision of the Court of Session
in Edinburgh, which upheld an employer in his claim to the
right of dismissing all the workmen and re-engaging them on
condition that they would dismiss a particular checkweigher.
In 1896 a short act extended the powers to propose, amend
and modify special rules, provided for representation of workmen
on arbitration under the principal act on any matter in difference,
modified the provision for plans of mines in working and
abandoned mines, amended three of the general rules (inspection
before commencing work, use of safety lamp and non-inflammable
substances for stemming), and empowered the secretary
of state by order to prohibit or regulate the use of any explosive
likely to become dangerous. In 1900 another brief act raised
the age of employment of boys underground from twelve to
thirteen. In 1903 another amending act allowed as an alternative
qualification for a manager&rsquo;s certificate a diploma in scientific
and mining training after at least two years&rsquo; study at a university
mining school or other educational institution approved by the
secretary of state, coupled with practical experience of at least
three years in a mine. In the same year the Employment
of Children Act affected children in mines to the extent already
indicated in connexion with factories. In 1905 a Coal Mines
(Weighing of Minerals) Act improved some provisions relating
to appointment and pay of checkweighers and facilities for them
and their duly appointed deputies in carrying out their duties.
In 1906 the Notice of Accidents Act provided for improved
annual returns of accidents and for immediate reporting to the
district inspector of accidents under newly-defined conditions
as they arise in coal and metalliferous mines.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>While the classes of mines regulated by the act of 1887 are the
same as those regulated by the act of 1872 (<i>i.e.</i> mines of coal, of
stratified ironstone, of shale and of fire-clay, including
works above ground where the minerals are prepared for
<span class="sidenote">Act of 1887.</span>
use by screening, washing, &amp;c.) the interpretation of the
term &ldquo;mine&rdquo; is wider and simpler, including &ldquo;every shaft in the
course of being sunk, and every level and inclined plane in the
course of being driven, and all the shafts, levels, planes, works,
tramways and sidings, both below ground and above ground, in and
adjacent to and belonging to the mine.&rdquo; Of the persons responsible
under penalty for the observance of the acts the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is
defined precisely as in the act of 1872, but the term &ldquo;agent&rdquo; is
modified to mean &ldquo;any person appointed as the representative of the
owner in respect of any mine or any part thereof, and, as such,
superior to a manager appointed in pursuance of this act.&rdquo; Of the
persons protected, the term &ldquo;young person&rdquo; disappeared from the
act, and &ldquo;boy,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;a male under the age of sixteen years,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;girl,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;a female under the age of sixteen years,&rdquo; take their
place, and the term &ldquo;woman&rdquo; means, as before, &ldquo;a female of the
age of sixteen years and upwards.&rdquo; The prohibition of employment
underground of women and girls remains untouched, and the prohibition
of employment underground of boys has been successively
extended from boys of the age of ten in 1872 to boys of twelve in
1887 and to boys of thirteen in 1900. The age of employment of
boys and girls above ground in connexion with any mine is raised
from ten years in 1872 to twelve years since 1887. The hours of
employment of a boy below ground may not exceed fifty-four in any
one week, nor ten in any one day from the time of leaving the surface
to the time of returning to the surface. Above ground any boy or
girl under thirteen (and over twelve) may not be employed on more
than six days in any one week; if employed on more than three days
in one week, the daily total must not exceed six hours, or in any other
case ten hours. Protected persons above thirteen are limited to the
same daily and weekly total of hours as boys below ground, but there
are further provisions with regard to intervals for meals and prohibiting
employment for more than five hours without an interval of
at least half an hour for a meal. Registers must be kept of all
protected persons, whether employed above or below ground.
Section 38 of the Public Health Act 1875, which requires separate and
sufficient sanitary conveniences for persons of each sex, was first
extended by the act of 1887 to the portions of mines above ground in
which girls and women are employed; underground this matter is in
metalliferous mines in Cornwall now provided for by special rules.
Ventilation, the only other requirement in the acts that can be classed
as sanitary, is provided for in every mine in the &ldquo;general rules&rdquo;
which are aimed at securing safety of mines, and which, so far as
ventilation is concerned, seek to dilute and render harmless noxious
or inflammable gases. The provision which prohibits employment
of any persons in mines not provided with at least two shafts is made
much more stringent by the act of 1887 than in the previous code, by
increasing the distance between the two shafts from 10 to 15 yds.,
and increasing the height of communications between them. Other
provisions amended or strengthened are those relating to the following
points: (<i>a</i>) Daily personal supervision of the mine by the certificated
manager; (<i>b</i>) classes of certificates and constitution of board for
granting certificates of competency; (<i>c</i>) plan of workings of any mine
to be kept up to a date not more than three months previously at the
office of the mine; (<i>d</i>) notice to be given to the inspector of the
district by the owner, agent or manager, of accidents in or about any
mine which cause loss of life or serious personal injury, or are caused
by explosion of coal or coal dust or any explosive or electricity or
any other special cause that the secretary of state specifies by order,
and which causes any personal injury to any person employed in or
about the mine; it is provided that the place where an explosion or
accident occurs causing loss of life or serious personal injury shall be
left for inspection for at least three days, unless this would tend to
increase or continue a danger or impede working of the mine: this
was new in the act of 1887; (<i>e</i>) notice to be given of opening and
abandonment of any mine: this was extended to the opening or
abandonment of any seam; (<i>f</i>) plan of an abandoned mine or seam
to be sent within three months; (<i>g</i>) formal investigation of any explosion
or accident by direction of the secretary of state: this
provision, first introduced by the act of 1886, was modified in 1887
to admit the appointment by the secretary of state of &ldquo;any competent
person&rdquo; to hold the investigation, whereas under the earlier
section only an inspector could be appointed.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;general rules&rdquo; for safety in mines have been strengthened in
many ways since the act of 1872. Particular mention may be made
of rule 4 of the act of 1887, relating to the inspection of
conditions as to gas ventilation beyond appointed stations
<span class="sidenote">General rules.</span>
at the entrance to the mine or different parts of the mine;
this rule generally removed the earlier distinction between mines in
which inflammable gas has been found within the preceding twelve
months, and mines in which it has not been so found; of rules 8, 9, 10
and 11, relating to the construction, use, &amp;c., of safety lamps, which
are more detailed and stringent than rule 7 of the act of 1872, which
they replaced; of rule 12, relating to the use of explosives below
ground; of rule 24, which requires the appointment of a competent
male person not less than twenty-two years of age for working the
machinery for lowering and raising persons at the mine; of rule 34,
which first required provision of ambulances or stretchers with
splints and bandages at the mine ready for immediate use; of rule
38, which strengthened the provision for periodical inspection of
the mine by practical miners on behalf of the workmen at their own
cost. With reference to the last-cited rule, during 1898 a Prussian
mining commission visited Great Britain, France and Belgium, to
study and compare the various methods of inspection by working
miners established in these three countries. They found that, so far
as the method had been applied, it was most satisfactory in Great
Britain, where the whole cost is borne by the workers&rsquo; own organizations,
and they attributed part of the decrease in number of accidents
per thousand employed since 1872 to the inauguration of this
system.</p>

<p>The provisions as to the proposal, amendment and modification
of &ldquo;special rules,&rdquo; last extended by the act of 1896, may be contrasted
with those of the Factory Act. In the latter
it is not until an industry or process has been scheduled
<span class="sidenote">Special rules.</span>
as dangerous or injurious by the secretary of state&rsquo;s
order that occasion arises for the formation of special rules, and
then the initiative rests with the Factory Department whereas in
mines it is incumbent in every case on the owner, agent or manager
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
to propose within three months of the commencement of any working,
for the approval of the secretary of state, special rules best
calculated to prevent dangerous accidents, and to provide for the
safety, convenience and proper discipline of the persons employed
in or about the mine. These rules may, if they relate to lights and
lamps used in the mine, description of explosives, watering and
damping of the mine, or prevention of accidents from inflammable
gas or coal dust, supersede any general rule in the principal act.
Apart from the initiation of the rules, the methods of establishing
them, whether by agreement or by resort to arbitration of the
parties (<i>i.e.</i> the mine owners and the secretary of state), are practically
the same as under the Factory Act, but there is special provision
in the Mines Acts for enabling the persons working in the mine to
transmit objections to the proposed rules, in addition to their subsequent
right to be represented on the arbitration, if any.</p>

<p>Of the sections touching on wages questions, the prohibition of
the payment of wages in public-houses remains unaltered, being
re-enacted in 1887; the sections relating to payment by weight for
amount of mineral gotten by persons employed, and for checkweighing
the amount by a &ldquo;checkweigher&rdquo; stationed by the majority
of workers at each place appointed for the weighing of the material,
were revised, particularly as to the determination of deductions by
the act of 1887, with a view to meeting some problems raised by
decisions on cases under the act of 1872. The attempt seems not to
have been wholly successful, the highest legal authorities having
expressed conflicting opinions on the precise meaning of the terms
&ldquo;mineral contracted to be gotten.&rdquo; The whole history of the development
of this means of securing the fulfilment of wage contract
to the workers may be compared with the history of the sections
affording protection to piece-workers by particulars of work and
wages in the textile trades since the Factory Act of 1891.</p>

<p>As regards legal proceedings, the chief amendments of the act of
1872 are: the extension of the provision that the &ldquo;owner, agent,
or manager&rdquo; charged in respect of any contravention
by another person might be sworn and examined as an
<span class="sidenote">Administration.</span>
ordinary witness, to any person charged with any offence
under the act. The result of the proceedings against workmen by
the owner, agent or manager in respect of an offence under the act
is to be reported within twenty-one days to the inspector of the
district. The powers of inspectors were extended to cover an inquiry
as to the care and treatment of horses and other animals in the mine,
and as to the control, management or direction of the mine by the
manager.</p>
</div>

<p>An important act was passed in 1908 (Coal Mines Regulation
Act 1908) limiting the hours of work for workmen below ground.
It enacted that, subject to various provisions, a workman was
not to be below ground in a mine for the purpose of his work,
and of going to and from his work, for more than eight hours
in any consecutive twenty-four hours. Exception was made
in the case of those below ground for the purpose of rendering
assistance in the event of an accident, or for meeting any danger,
or for dealing with any emergency or work incompleted, through
unforeseen circumstances, which requires to be dealt with to
avoid serious interference in the work of the mine. The
authorities of every mine must fix the times for the lowering
and raising of the men to begin and be completed, and such
times must be conspicuously posted at the pit head. These
times must be approved by an inspector. The term &ldquo;workman&rdquo;
in the act means any person employed in a mine below ground
who is not an official of the mine (other than a fireman, examiner
or deputy), or a mechanic or a horse keeper or a person engaged
solely in surveying or measuring. In the case of a fireman,
examiner, deputy, onsetter, pump minder, fanman or furnace
man, the maximum period for which he may be below ground
is nine hours and a half. A register must be kept by the
authorities of the mine of the times of descent and ascent,
while the workmen may, at their own cost, station persons
(whether holding the office of checkweigher or not) at the pit
head to observe the times. The authorities of the mine may
extend the hours of working by one hour a day on not more than
sixty days in one calendar year (s. 3). The act may be suspended
by order in council in the event of war or of imminent national
danger or great emergency, or in the event of any grave economic
disturbance due to the demand for coal exceeding the supply
available at any time. The act came into force on the 1st of
July 1909 except for the counties of Northumberland and Durham
where its operation was postponed until the 1st of January 1910.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1905 the number of coal-mines reported on was 3126, and the
number of persons employed below ground was 691,112 of whom
43,443 were under 16 years of age. Above ground 167,261 were
employed, of whom 6154 were women and girls. The number of
separate fatal accidents was 1006, causing the loss of 1205 lives. Of
prosecutions by far the greater number were against workmen,
numbering in coal and metalliferous mines 953; owners and
managers were prosecuted in 72 cases, and convictions obtained in
43 cases.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Quarries.</i>&mdash;From 1878 until 1894 open quarries (as distinct
from underground quarries regulated by the Metalliferous
Mines Regulation Act) were regulated only by the Factory
Acts so far as they then applied. It was laid down in section
93 of the act of 1878 (41 Vict. c. 16), that &ldquo;any premises or place
shall not be excluded from the definition of a factory or workshop
by reason only that such premises, &amp;c., are or is in the open
air,&rdquo; thereby overruling the decision in <i>Kent</i> v. <i>Astley</i> that
quarries in which the work, as a whole, was carried on in the open
air were not factories; in a schedule to the same act quarries
were defined as &ldquo;any place not being a mine in which persons
work in getting slate, stone, coprolites or other minerals.&rdquo;
The Factory Act of 1891 made it possible to bring these places
in part under &ldquo;special rules&rdquo; adapted to meet the special risks
and dangers of the operations carried on in them, and by order
of the secretary of state they were certified, December 1892,
as dangerous, and thereby subject to special rules. Until then,
as reported by one of the inspectors of factories, quarries had
been placed under the Factory Acts without insertion of appropriate
rules for their safe working, and many of them were
&ldquo;developed in a most dangerous manner without any regard
for safety, but merely for economy,&rdquo; and managers of many had
&ldquo;scarcely seen a quarry until they became managers.&rdquo; In his
report for 1892 it was recommended by the chief inspector of
factories that quarries should be subject to the jurisdiction of
the government inspectors of mines. At the same time currency
was given, by the published reports of the evidence before the
Royal Commission on Labour, to the wish of large numbers
of quarrymen that open as well as underground quarries should
come under more specialized government inspection. In 1893
a committee of experts, including inspectors of mines and of
factories, was appointed by the Home Office to investigate the
conditions of labour in open quarries, and in 1894 the Quarries
Act brought every quarry, as defined in the Factory Act 1878,
any part of which is more than 20 ft. deep, under certain of the
provisions of the Metalliferous Mines Acts, and under the
inspection of the inspectors appointed under those acts; further,
it transferred the duty of enforcing the Factory and Workshop
Acts, so far as they apply in quarries over 20 ft. deep, from the
Factory to the Metalliferous Mines inspectors.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Metalliferous Mines Acts 1872 and 1875,
applied to quarries, are those relating to payment of wages in
public-houses, notice of accidents to the inspector, appointment
and powers of inspectors, arbitration, coroners&rsquo; inquests, special
rules, penalties, certain of the definitions, and the powers of
the secretary of state finally to decide disputed questions whether
places come within the application of the acts. For other
matters, and in particular fencing of machinery and employment
of women and young persons, the Factory Acts apply, with a
proviso that nothing shall prevent the employment of young
persons (boys) in three shifts for not more than eight hours
each. In 1899 it was reported by the inspectors of mines that
special rules for safety had been established in over 2000 quarries.
In the reports for 1905 it was reported that the accounts of blasting
accidents indicated that there was &ldquo;still much laxity in
observance of the Special rules, and that many irregular and
dangerous practices are in vogue.&rdquo; The absence or deficiency
of external fencing to a quarry dangerous to the public has been
since 1887 (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. 19) deemed a nuisance liable to be
dealt with summarily in the manner provided by the Public
Health Act 1875.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1905, 94,819 persons were employed, of whom 59,978 worked
inside the actual pits or excavations, and 34,841 outside. Compared
with 1900, there was a total increase of 924 in the number of persons
employed. Fatal accidents resulted in 1900 in 127 deaths; compared
with 1899 there was an increase of 10 in the number of deaths, and, as
Professor Le Neve Foster pointed out, this exceeded the average
death-rate of underground workers at mines under the Coal Mines
Acts during the previous ten years, in spite of the quarrier &ldquo;having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
nothing to fear from explosions of gas, underground fires or inundations.&rdquo;
He attributed the difference to a lax observance of precautions
which might in time be remedied by stringent administration
of the law. In 1905 there were 97 fatal accidents resulting in
99 deaths. In 1900 there were 92 prosecutions against owners or
agents, with 67 convictions, and 13 prosecutions of workers, with 12
convictions, and in 1905 there were 45 prosecutions of owners or
agents with 43 convictions and 9 prosecutions of workmen with 5
convictions.</p>

<p>In 1883 a short act extended to all &ldquo;workmen&rdquo; who are manual
labourers other than miners, with the exception of domestic or
menial servants, the prohibition of payment of wages in
public-houses, beer-shops and other places for the sale
<span class="sidenote">Payment of wages in public-houses.</span>
of spirituous or fermented liquor, laid down in the Coal
Mines Regulations and Metalliferous Mines Regulation
Acts. The places covered by the prohibition include any
office, garden or place belonging to or occupied with the places
named, but the act does not apply to such wages as are paid by the
resident, owner or occupier of the public-house, beer-shop and other
places included in the prohibition to any workman <i>bona fide</i> employed
by him. The penalty for an offence against this act is one
not exceeding £10 (compare the limit of £20 for the corresponding
offence under the Coal Mines Act), and all offences may be prosecuted
and penalties recovered in England and Scotland under the Summary
Jurisdiction Acts. The act does not apply to Ireland, and no special
inspectorate is charged with the duty of enforcing its provisions.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Shop Hours</i>.&mdash;In four brief acts, 1892 to 1899, still in force,
the first very limited steps were taken towards the positive
regulation of the employment of shop assistants. In the act
of 1904 certain additional optional powers were given to any
local authority making a &ldquo;closing order&rdquo; fixing the hour (not
earlier than 7 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> or on one day in the week 1 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>) at which
shops shall cease to serve customers throughout the area of
the authority or any specified part thereof as regards all shops
or as regards any specified class of shops. Before such an order
can be made (1) a prima facie case for it must appear to the local
authority; (2) the local authority must inquire and agree;
(3) the order must be drafted and sent for confirmation or otherwise
to the central authority, that is, the secretary of state for
the Home Department; (4) the order must be laid before
both Houses of Parliament. The Home Office has given every
encouragement to the making of such orders, but their number
in England is very small, and the act is practically inoperative
in London and many large towns where the need is greatest.
As the secretary of state pointed out in the House of Commons
on the 1st of May 1907, the local authorities have not taken
enough initiative, but at the same time there is a great difficulty
for them in obtaining the required two-thirds majority, among
occupiers of the shops to be affected, in favour of the order,
and at the same time shop assistants have no power to set the
law in motion. In England 364 local authorities have taken
no steps, but in Scotland rather better results have been
obtained. The House resolved, on the date named, that more
drastic legislation is required. As regards shops, therefore, in
place of such general codes as apply to factories, laundries,
mines&mdash;only three kinds of protective requirement are binding
on employers of shop assistants: (1) Limitation of the weekly
total of hours of work of persons under eighteen years of age
to seventy-four inclusive of meal-times; (2) prohibition of the
employment of such persons in a shop on the same day that they
have, to the knowledge of the employer, been employed in any
factory or workshop for a longer period than would, in both
classes of employment together, amount to the number of hours
permitted to such persons in a factory or workshop; (3) provision
for the supply of seats by the employer, in all rooms of a shop
or other premises where goods are retailed to the public, for the
use of female assistants employed in retailing the goods&mdash;the
seats to be in the proportion of not fewer than one to every
three female assistants. The first two requirements are contained
in the act of 1892, which also prescribed that a notice, referring
to the provisions of the act, and stating the number of hours
in the week during which a young person may be lawfully
employed in the shop, shall be kept exhibited by the employer;
the third requirement was first provided by the act of 1899.
The intervening acts of 1893 and 1895 are merely supplementary
to the act of 1892; the former providing for the salaries and
expenses of the inspectors which the council of any county or
borough (and in the City of London the Common Council) were
empowered by the act of 1892 to appoint; the latter providing
a penalty of 40s. for failure of an employer to keep
exhibited the notice of the provisions of the acts, which in the
absence of a penalty it had been impossible to enforce. The
penalty for employment contrary to the acts is a fine not exceeding
£1 for each person so employed, and for failure to comply with
the requirements as to seats, a fine not exceeding £3 for a first
offence, and for any subsequent offence a fine of not less than
£1 and not exceeding £5.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A wide interpretation is given by the act of 1892 to the class
of workplace to which the limitation of hours applies. &ldquo;Shop&rdquo;
means retail and wholesale shops, markets, stalls and
warehouses in which assistants are employed for hire,
<span class="sidenote">Meaning of &ldquo;shop.&rdquo;</span>
and includes licensed public-houses and refreshment
houses of any kind. The person responsible for the observance of
the acts is the &ldquo;employer&rdquo; of the &ldquo;young persons&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> persons
under the age of eighteen years), whose hours are limited, and of
the &ldquo;female assistants&rdquo; for whom seats must be provided. Neither
the term &ldquo;employer&rdquo; nor &ldquo;shop assistant&rdquo; (used in the title of the
act of 1899) is defined; but other terms have the meaning assigned
to them in the Factory and Workshop Act 1878. The &ldquo;employer&rdquo;
has, in case of any contravention alleged, the same power as the
&ldquo;occupier&rdquo; in the Factory Acts to exempt himself from fine on proof
of due diligence and of the fact that some other person is the actual
offender. The provisions of the act of 1892 do not apply to members
of the same family living in a house of which the shop forms part, or
to members of the employer&rsquo;s family, or to any one wholly employed
as a domestic servant.</p>

<p>In London, where the County Council has appointed men and
women inspectors to apply the acts of 1892 to 1899, there were, in
1900, 73,929 premises, and in 1905, 84,269, under inspection. In the
latter year there were 22,035 employing persons under 18 years of
age. In 1900 the number of young persons under the acts were:
indoors, 10,239 boys and 4428 girls; outdoors, 35,019 boys, 206
girls. In 1905 the ratio between boys and girls had decidedly altered:
indoors, 6602 boys, 4668 girls; outdoors, 22,654 boys, 308 girls. The
number of irregularities reported in 1900 were 9204 and the prosecutions
were 117; in 1905 the irregularities were 6966 and the
prosecutions numbered 34. As regards the act of 1899, in only
1088 of the 14,844 shops affected in London was there found in 1900
to be failure to provide seats for the women employed in retailing
goods. The chief officer of the Public Control Department reported
that with very few exceptions the law was complied with at the end
of the first year of its application.</p>

<p>As regards cleanliness, ventilation, drainage, water-supply and
sanitary condition generally, shops have been since 1878 (by 41
Vict. c. 16, s. 101) subject to the provisions of the Public Health
Act 1875, which apply to all buildings, except factories under the
Factory Acts, in which any persons, whatever their number be, are
employed. Thus, broadly, the same sanitary provisions apply in
shops as in workshops, but in the former these are enforced solely
by the officers of the local authority, without reservation of any
power, as in workshops for the Home Office inspectorate, to act in
default of the local authority.</p>

<p>Shop assistants, so far as they are engaged in manual, not merely
clerical labour, come under the provisions of the Truck Acts 1831 to
1887, and in all circumstances they fall within the sections directed
against unfair and unreasonable fines in the Truck Act of 1896; but,
unlike employés in factories, workshops, laundries and mines, they
are left to apply these provisions so far as they can themselves, since
neither Home Office inspectors nor officers of the local authority have
any specially assigned powers to administer the Truck Acts in shops.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Truck.</i>&mdash;Setting aside the special Hosiery Manufacture
(Wages) Act 1874, aimed at a particular abuse appearing chiefly
in the hosiery industry&mdash;the practice of making excessive
charges on wages for machinery and frame rents&mdash;only two
acts, those of 1887 and 1896, have been added to the general
law against truck since the act of 1831, which repealed all prior
Truck Acts and which remains the principal act. Further
amendments of the law have been widely and strenuously demanded,
and are hoped for as the result of the long inquiry
by a departmental committee appointed early in 1906. The
Truck Act Amendment Act 1887, amended and extended the
act without adding any distinctly new principle; the Truck
Act of 1896 was directed towards providing remedies for matters
shown by decisions under the earlier Truck Acts to be outside
the scope of the principles and provisions of those acts. Under
the earlier acts the main objects were: (1) to make the wages
of workmen, <i>i.e.</i> the reward of labour, payable only in current
coin of the realm, and to prohibit whole or part payment of
wages in food or drink or clothes or any other articles; (2) to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
forbid agreements, express or implied, between employer and
workmen as to the manner or place in which, or articles on which,
a workman shall expend his wages, or for the deduction from
wages of the price of articles (other than materials to be used
in the labour of the workmen) supplied by the employer. The
<span class="sidenote">The Truck Act 1887.</span>
act of 1887 added a further prohibition by making
it illegal for an employer to charge interest on any
advance of wages, &ldquo;whenever by agreement, custom,
or otherwise a workman is entitled to receive in anticipation of
the regular period of the payment of his wages an advance as
part or on account thereof.&rdquo; Further, it strengthened the section
of the principal act which provided that no employer shall have
any action against his workman for goods supplied at any shop
belonging to the employer, or in which the employer is interested,
by (<i>a</i>) securing any workman suing an employer for wages against
any counter-claim in respect of goods supplied to the workman
by any person under any order or direction of the employer,
and (<i>b</i>) by expressly prohibiting an employer from dismissing
any worker on account of any particular time, place or manner
of expending his wages. Certain exemptions to the prohibition
of payment otherwise than in coin were provided for in the act
of 1831, if an agreement were made in writing and signed by
the worker, viz. rent, victuals dressed and consumed under the
employer&rsquo;s roof, medicine, fuel, provender for beasts of burden
used in the trade, materials and tools for use by miners, advances
for friendly societies or savings banks; in the case of fuel, provender
and tools there was also a proviso that the charge should
not exceed the real and true value. The act of 1887 amended
these provisions by requiring a correct annual audit in the case
of deductions for medicine or tools, by permitting part payment
of servants in husbandry in food, drink (not intoxicants) or
other allowances, and by prohibiting any deductions for sharpening
or repairing workmen&rsquo;s tools except by agreement not forming
part of the condition of hiring. Two important administrative
amendments were made by the act of 1887: (1) a section
similar to that in the Factory and Mines Acts was added, empowering
the employer to exempt himself from penalty for contravention
of the acts on proof that any other person was the actual
offender and of his own due diligence in enforcing the execution
of the acts; (2) the duty of enforcing the acts in factories,
workshops, and mines was imposed upon the inspectors of the
Factory and Mines Departments, respectively, of the Home
Office, and to their task they were empowered to bring all the
authorities and powers which they possessed in virtue of the
acts under which they are appointed; these inspectors thus
prosecute defaulting employers and recover penalties under the
Summary Jurisdiction Acts, but they do not undertake civil
proceedings for improper deductions or payments, proceedings
for which would lie with workmen under the Employers and
<span class="sidenote">Persons benefited by Truck Acts.</span>
Workmen Act 1875. The persons to whom the
benefits of the act applied were added to by the act
of 1887, which repealed the complicated list of trades
contained in the principal act and substituted the
simpler definition of the Employers and Workmen Act, 1875.
Thus the acts 1831 to 1887, and also the act of 1896, apply to
all workers (men, women and children) engaged in manual
labour, except domestic servants; they apply not only in mines,
factories and workshops, but, to quote the published Home
Office Memorandum on the acts, &ldquo;in all places where workpeople
are engaged in manual labour under a contract with an
employer, whether or no the employer be an owner or agent or
a parent, or be himself a workman; and therefore a workman
who employs and pays others under him must also observe the
Truck Acts.&rdquo; The law thus in certain circumstances covers
outworkers for a contractor or sub-contractor. A decision of
the High Court at Dublin in 1900 (<i>Squire</i> v. <i>Sweeney</i>) strengthened
the inspectors in investigation of offences committed amongst
outworkers by supporting the contention that inquiry and
exercise of all the powers of an inspector could legally take
place in parts of an employer&rsquo;s premises other than those in
which the work is given out. It defined for Ireland, in a narrower
sense than had hitherto been understood and acted upon by
the Factory Department, the classes of outworkers protected,
by deciding that only such as were under a contract personally
to execute the work were covered. In 1905 the law in England
was similarly declared in the decided case of <i>Squire</i> v. <i>The
Midland Lace Co.</i> The judges (Lord Alverstone, C.J.; and
Kennedy and Ridley, J.J.) stated that they came to the conclusion
with &ldquo;reluctance,&rdquo; and said: &ldquo;We venture to express
the hope that some amendment of the law may be made so as
to extend the protection of the Truck Act to a class of workpeople
indistinguishable from those already within its provisions.&rdquo;
The workers in question were lace-clippers taking out work to
do in their homes, and in the words of the High Court decision
&ldquo;though they do sometimes employ assistants are evidently,
as a class, wage-earning manual labourers and not contractors
in the ordinary and popular sense.&rdquo; The principle relied on in
the decision was that in the case of <i>Ingram</i> v. <i>Barnes</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>At the time of the passing of the act of 1887 it seems to have been
generally believed that the obligation under the principal act to pay
the &ldquo;entire amount of wages earned&rdquo; in coin rendered
illegal any deductions from wages in respect of fines.
<span class="sidenote">Meaning of &ldquo;wages.&rdquo;</span>
Important decisions in 1888 and 1889 showed this belief
to have been ill-founded. The essential point lies in the definition
of the word &ldquo;wages&rdquo; as the &ldquo;recompense, reward or remuneration
of labour,&rdquo; which implies not necessarily any gross sum in question
between employer and workmen where there is a contract to perform
a certain piece of work, but that part of it, the real <i>net</i> wage, which the
workman was to get as his <i>recompense</i> for the labour performed. As
soon as it became clear that excessive deductions from wages as well
as payments by workers for materials used in the work were not
illegal, and that deductions or payments by way of compensation to
employers or by way of discipline might legally (with the single
exception of fines for lateness for women and children, regulated by
the Employers and Workmen Act 1875) even exceed the degree of
loss, hindrance or damage to the employer, it also came clearly into
view that further legislation was desirable to extend the principles
at the root of the Truck Acts. It was desirable, that is to say, to
hinder more fully the unfair dealing that may be encouraged by half-defined
customs in workplaces, on the part of the employer in making
a contract, while at the same time leaving the principle of freedom
<span class="sidenote">The Truck Act 1896.</span>
of contract as far as possible untouched. The Truck Act
of 1896 regulates the conditions under which deductions
can be made by or payments made to the employer, out
of the &ldquo;sum contracted to be paid to the worker,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> out of any
gross sum whatever agreed upon between employer and workman.
It makes such deductions or payments illegal unless they are in
pursuance of a contract; and it provides that deductions (or payments)
for (<i>a</i>) fines, (<i>b</i>) bad work and damaged goods, (<i>c</i>) materials,
machines, and any other thing provided by the employer in relation
to the work shall be reasonable, and that particulars of the same in
writing shall be given to the workman. In none of the cases mentioned
is the employer to make any profit; neither by fines, for
they may only be imposed in respect of acts or omissions which cause,
or are likely to cause, loss or damage; nor by sale of materials, for
the price may not exceed the cost to the employer; nor by deductions
or payments for damage, for these may not exceed the actual or
estimated loss to the employer. Fines and charges for damage must
be &ldquo;fair and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the
case,&rdquo; and no contract could make legal a fine which a court held
to be unfair to the workman in the sense of the act. The contract
between the employer and workman must either be in writing signed
by the workman, or its terms must be clearly stated in a notice
constantly affixed in a place easily accessible to the workman to
whom, if a party to the contract, a copy shall be given at the time of
making the contract, and who shall be entitled, on request, to obtain
from the employer a copy of the notice free of charge. On each
occasion when a deduction or payment is made, full particulars in
writing must be supplied to the workman. The employer is bound to
keep a register of deductions or payments, and to enter therein
particulars of any fine made under the contract, specifying the
amount and nature of the act or omission in respect of which the fine
was imposed. This register must be at all times open to inspectors
of mines or factories, who are entitled to make a copy of the contract
or any part of it. This act as a whole applies to all workmen included
under the earlier Truck Acts; the sections relating to fines
apply also to shop assistants. The latter, however, apparently are
left to enforce the provisions of the law themselves, as no inspectorate
is empowered to intervene on their behalf. In these and other cases
a prosecution under the Truck Acts may be instituted by any person.
Any workman or shop assistant may recover any sum deducted by
or paid to his employer contrary to the act of 1896, provided that
proceedings are commenced within six months, and that where he
has acquiesced in the deduction or payment he shall only recover
the excess over the amount which the court may find to have been
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. It is expressly
declared in the act that nothing in it shall affect the provisions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
of the Coal Mines Acts with reference to payment by weight, or
legalize any deductions, from payments made, in pursuance of those
provisions. The powers and duties of inspectors are extended to
cover the case of a laundry, and of any place where work is given out
by the occupier of a factory or workshop or by a contractor or sub-contractor.
Power is reserved for the secretary of state to exempt
by order specified trades or branches of them in specified areas from
the provisions of the act of 1896, if he is satisfied that they are unnecessary
for the protection of the workmen. This power has been
exercised only in respect of one highly organized industry, the
Lancashire cotton industry. The effect of the exemption is not to
prevent fines and deductions from being made, but the desire for
it demonstrated that there are cases where leaders among workers
have felt competent to make their own terms on their own lines
without the specific conditions laid down in this act. The reports
of the inspectors of factories have demonstrated that in other industries
much work has had to be done under this act, and knowledge
of a highly technical character to be gradually acquired, before
opinions could be formed as to the reasonableness and fairness, or
the contrary, of many forms of deduction. Owing partly to difficulties
of legal interpretation involving the necessity of taking test
cases into court, partly to the margin for differences of opinion as to
what constitutes &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; in a deduction, the average
number of convictions obtained on prosecutions is not so high as
under the Factory Acts, though the average penalty imposed is
higher. In 1904, 61 cases were taken into court resulting in 34
convictions with an average penalty of £1, 10s. In 1905, 38 cases
resulting in 34 convictions were taken with an average penalty of
£1, 3s. In 1906, 37 cases resulting in 25 convictions were taken with
an average penalty of £1, 10s.</p>

<p>Reference should here be made to the Shop Clubs Act of 1902 as
closely allied with some of the provisions of the Truck Acts by its
provision that employers shall not make it a condition of employment
that any workman shall become a member of a shop club unless it is
registered under the Friendly Societies Act of 1896. As in the case of
payment of wages in Public Houses Act, no special inspectorate has
the duty of enforcing this act.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">III. Continental Europe</span></p>

<p>In comparing legislation affecting factories, mines, shops and
truck in the chief industrial countries of the continent with that
of Great Britain, it is essential to a just view that inquiry should
be extended beyond the codes themselves to the general social
order and system of law and administration in each country.
Further, special comparison of the definitions and the sanctions
of each industrial code must be recognized as necessary, for
these vary in all. In so brief a summary as is appended here
no more is possible than an outline indication of the main general
requirements and prohibitions of the laws as regards: (1) hours
and times of employment, (2) ordinary sanitation and special
requirements for unhealthy and dangerous industries, (3) security
against accidents, and (4) prevention of fraud and oppression in
fulfilment of wage contracts. As regards the first of these subdivisions,
in general in Europe the ordinary legal limit is rather
wider than in Great Britain, being in several countries not less
than 11 hours a day, and while in some, as in France, the normal
limit is 10 hours daily, yet the administrative discretion in granting
exceptions is rather more elastic. The weekly half-holiday
is a peculiarly British institution. On the other hand,
in several European countries, notably France, Austria, Switzerland
and Russia, the legal maximum day applies to adult as
well as youthful labour, and not only to specially protected
classes of persons. As regards specialized sanitation for unhealthy
factory industries, German regulations appear to be
most nearly comparable with British. Mines&rsquo; labour regulation
in several countries, having an entirely different origin linked
with ownership of mines, is only in few and most recent developments
comparable with British Mines Regulation Acts. In
regulation of shops, Germany, treating this matter as an integral
part of her imperial industrial code, has advanced farther than
has Great Britain. In truck legislation most European countries
(with the exception of France) appear to have been influenced
by the far earlier laws of Great Britain, although in some respects
Belgium, with her rapid and recent industrial development,
has made interesting original experiments. The rule of Sunday
rest (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sunday</a></span>) has been extended in several countries,
most recently in Belgium and Spain. In France this partially
attempted rule has been so modified as to be practically a seventh
day rest, not necessarily Sunday.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>France.</i>&mdash;Hours of labour were, in France, first limited in factories
(<i>usines et manufactures</i>) for adults by the law of the 9th of September
1848 to 12 in the 24. Much uncertainty existed as to the class of
workplaces covered. Finally, in 1885, an authoritative decision
defined them as including: (1) Industrial establishments with motor
power or continual furnaces, (2) workshops employing over 20
workers. In 1851, under condition of notification to the local
authorities, exceptions, still in force, were made to the general limitation,
in favour of certain industries or processes, among others for
letterpress and lithographic printing, engineering works, work at
furnaces and in heating workshops, manufacture of projectiles of war,
and any work for the government in the interests of national defence
or security. The limit of 12 hours was reduced, as regards works in
which women or young workers are employed, in 1900 to 11, and was
to be successively reduced to 10½ hours and to 10 hours at intervals
of two years from April 1900. This labour law for adults was preceded
in 1841 by one for children, which prevented their employment
in factories before 8 years of age and prohibited night labour for any
child under 13. This was strengthened in 1874, particularly as
regards employment of girls under 21, but it was not until 1892 that
the labour of women was specially regulated by a law, still in force,
with certain amendments in 1900. Under this law factory and workshop
labour is prohibited for children under 13 years, though they
may begin at 12 if qualified by the prescribed educational certificate
and medical certificate of fitness. The limit of daily hours of employment
is the same as for adult labour, and, similarly, from the
1st of April 1902 was 10½, and two years later became 10 hours in the
24. Notice of the hours must be affixed, and meal-times or pauses
with absolute cessation of work of at least one hour must be specified.
By the act of 1892 one day in the week, not necessarily Sunday, had
to be given for entire absence from work, in addition to eight recognized
annual holidays, but this was modified by a law of 1906 which
generally requires Sunday rest, but allows substitution of another day
in certain industries and certain circumstances. Night labour&mdash;work
between 9 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> and 5 <span class="scs">A.M.</span>&mdash;is prohibited for workers under 18,
and only exceptionally permitted, under conditions, for girls and
women over 18 in specified trades. In mines and underground
quarries employment of women and girls is prohibited except at
surface works, and at the latter is subject to the same limits as in
factories. Boys of 13 may be employed in certain work underground,
but under 16 may not be employed more than 8 hours in the 24 from
bank to bank. A law of 1905 provided for miners a 9 hours&rsquo; day
and in 1907 an 8 hours&rsquo; day from the foot of the entrance gallery
back to the same point.</p>

<p>As in Great Britain, distinct services of inspection enforce the
law in factories and mines respectively. In factories and workshops
an inspector may order re-examination as to physical fitness for the
work imposed of any worker under 16; certain occupations and
processes are prohibited&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> girls under 16 at machines worked by
treadles, and the weights that may be lifted, pushed or carried by
girls or boys under 18 are carefully specified. The law applies
generally to philanthropic and religious institutions where industrial
work is carried on, as in ordinary trading establishments; and this
holds good even if the work is by way of technical instruction.
Domestic workshops are not controlled unless the industry is classed
as dangerous or unhealthy; introduction of motor power brings them
under inspection. General sanitation in industrial establishments is
provided for in a law of 1893, amended in 1903, and is supplemented
by administrative regulations for special risks due to poisons, dust,
explosive substances, gases, fumes, &amp;c. Ventilation, both general
and special, lighting, provision of lavatories, cloakrooms, good
drinking water, drainage and cleanliness are required in all workplaces,
shops, warehouses, restaurant kitchens, and where workers
are lodged by their employers hygienic conditions are prescribed for
dormitories. In many industries women, children and young
workers are either absolutely excluded from specified unhealthy processes,
or are admitted only under conditions. As regards shops and
offices, the labour laws are: one which protects apprentices against
overwork (law of 22nd February 1851), one (law of 29th December
1900) which requires that seats shall be provided for women and girls
employed in retail sale of articles, and a decree of the 28th of July
1904 defining in detail conditions of hygiene in dormitories for workmen
and shop assistants. The law relating to seats is enforced by the
inspectors of factories. In France there is no special penal legislation
against abuses of the truck system, or excessive fines and
deductions from wages, although bills with that end in view have
frequently been before parliament. Indirect protection to workers
is no doubt in many cases afforded in organized industries by the
action of the <i>Conseils de Prud&rsquo;hommes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Belgium.</i>&mdash;In 1848 in Belgium the Commission on Labour proposed
legislation to limit, as in France, the hours of labour for adults,
but this proposal was never passed. Belgian regulation of labour
in industry remains essentially, in harmony with its earliest beginnings
in 1863 and onwards, a series of specialized provisions to meet
particular risks of individual trades, and did not, until 1889, give any
adherence to a common principle of limitation of hours and times of
labour for &ldquo;protected&rdquo; persons. This was in the law of the 13th of
December 1889, which applies to mines, quarries, factories, workshops
classed as unhealthy, wharves and docks, transports. As in
France, industrial establishments having a charitable or philanthropic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
or educational character are included. The persons protected are
girls and women under 21 years, and boys under 16; and women
over 21 only find a place in the law through the prohibition of their
employment within four weeks after childbirth. As the hours of
labour of adult women remain ordinarily unlimited by law, so are
the hours of boys from 16 to 21. The law of Sunday rest dated the
17th of July 1905, however, applies to labour generally in all industrial
and commercial undertakings except transport and fisheries,
with certain regulated exceptions for (<i>a</i>) cases of breakdown or
urgency due to <i>force majeure</i>, (<i>b</i>) certain repairs and cleaning, (<i>c</i>)
perishable materials, (<i>d</i>) retail food supply. Young workers are
excluded from the exceptions. The absolute prohibitions of employment
are: for children under 12 years in any industry, manufacturing
or mining or transport, and for women and girls under 21
years below the surface in working of mines. Boys under 16 years
and women and girls under 21 years may in general not be employed
before 5 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> or after 9 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, and one day in the seven is to be
set apart for rest from employment; to these rules exception may
be made either by royal decree for classes or groups of processes, or
by local authorities in exceptional cases. The exceptions may be
applied, generally, only to workers over 14 years, but in mines, by
royal decree, boys over 12 years may be employed from 4 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> The
law of 1889 fixes only a maximum of 12 hours of effective work, to be
interrupted by pauses for rest of not less than 1½ hours, empowering
the king by decree to formulate more precise limits suited to the
special circumstances of individual industries. Royal decrees have
accordingly laid down the conditions for many groups, including
textile trades, manufacture of paper, pottery, glass, clothing, mines,
quarries, engineering and printing works. In some the daily limit
is 10 hours, but in more 10½ or 11 hours. In a few exceptionally unhealthy
trades, such as the manufacture of lucifer matches, vulcanization
of india-rubber by means of carbon bi-sulphide, the age of exclusion
from employment has been raised, and in the last-named
process hours have been reduced to 5, broken into two spells of 2½
hours each. As a rule the conditions of health and safeguarding of
employments in exceptionally injurious trades have been sought by
a series of decrees under the law of 1863 relating to public health in
such industries. Special regulations for safety of workers have been
introduced in manufactures of white-lead, oxides of lead, chromate
of lead, lucifer match works, rag and shoddy works; and for dangers
common to many industries, provisions against dust, poisons,
accidents and other risks to health or limb have been codified in a
decree of 1896. A royal decree of the 31st of March 1903 prohibits
employment of persons under 16 years in fur-pulling and in carotting
of rabbit skins, and another of the 13th of May 1905 regulates use of
lead in house-painting. In 1898 a law was passed to enable the
authorities to deal with risks in quarries under the same procedure.
Safety in mines (which are not private property, but state concessions
to be worked under strict state control) has been provided for
since 1810. In matters of hygiene, until 1899 the powers of the
public health authorities to intervene were insufficient, and a law
was passed authorizing the government to make regulations for every
kind of risk in any undertaking, whether classed under the law of
public health or not. By a special law of 1888 children and young
persons under 18 years are excluded from employment as pedlars,
hawkers or in circuses, except by their parents, and then only if they
have attained 14 years. Abuses of the truck system have, since 1887,
been regulated with care. The chief objects of the law of 1887 were
to secure payment in full to all workers, other than those in agriculture
or domestic service, of wages in legal tender, to prohibit
payment of wages in public-houses, and to secure prompt payment of
wages. Certain deductions were permitted under careful control for
specific customary objects: lodging, use of land, uniforms, food,
firing. A royal order of the 10th of October 1903 required use of
automatic indicators for estimating wages in certain cases in textile
processes. The law of the 15th of June 1896 regulates the affixing in
workplaces, where at least five workers are employed, of a notice
of the working rules, the nature and rate of fines, if any, and the mode
of their application. Two central services the mines inspectorate
and the factory and workshop inspectorate, divide the duties above
indicated. There is also a system of local administration of the
regulations relating to industries classed as unhealthy, but the
tendency has been to give the supreme control in these matters to the
factory service, with its expert staff.</p>

<p><i>Holland.</i>&mdash;The first law for regulation of labour in manufacture
was passed in 1874, and this related only to employment of children.
The basis of all existing regulations was established in the law of the
5th of May 1889, which applies to all industrial undertakings, excluding
agriculture and forestry, fishing, stock-rearing. Employment
of children under 12 years is prohibited, and hours are limited
for young persons under 16 and for women of any age. These protected
persons may be excluded by royal decree from unhealthy
industries, and such industries are specified in a decree of 1897
which supersedes other earlier regulations. Hours of employment
must not exceed 11 in the 24, and at least one hour for rest must be
given between 11 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> and 3 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, which hour must not be spent in a
workroom. Work before 5 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> or after 7 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, Sunday work, and
work on recognized holidays is generally prohibited, but there are
exceptions. Overtime from 7 to 10 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, under conditions, is allowed
for women and young workers, and Sunday work for women, for
example, in butter and cheese making, and night work for boys over
14 in certain industries. Employment of women within four weeks
of childbirth is prohibited. Notices of working hours must be
affixed in workplaces. Underground work in mines is prohibited for
women and young persons under 16, but in Holland mining is a very
small industry. In 1895 the first legislative provision was made for
protection of workers against risk of accident or special injury to
health. Sufficient cubic space, lighting, ventilation, sanitary accommodation,
reasonable temperature, removal of noxious gases or
dust, fencing of machinery, precautions against risk from fire and
other matters are provided for. The manufacture of lucifer matches
by means of white phosphorus was forbidden and the export, importation
and sale was regulated by a law of the 28th of May 1901. By
a regulation of the 16th of March 1904 provisions for safety and
health of women and young workers were strengthened in processes
where lead compounds or other poisons are used, and their employment
at certain dangerous machines and in cleaning machinery or
near driving belts was prohibited. No penal provision against
truck exists in Holland, but possibly abuses of the system are prevented
by the existence of industrial councils representing both
employers and workers, with powers to mediate or arbitrate in case
of disputes.</p>

<p><i>Switzerland.</i>&mdash;In Switzerland separate cantonal legislation prepared
the way for the general Federal labour law of 1877 on which
subsequent legislation rests. Such legislation is also cantonal as
well as Federal, but in the latter there is only amplification or
interpretation of the principles contained in the law of 1877, whereas
cantonal legislation covers industries not included under the Federal
law, <i>e.g.</i> single workers employed in a trade (<i>métier</i>) and employment
in shops, offices and hotels. The Federal law is applied to factories,
workshops employing young persons under 18 or more than 10
workers, and workshops in which unhealthy or dangerous processes
are carried on. Mines are not included, but are regulated in some
respects as regards health and safety by cantonal laws. Further,
the Law of Employers&rsquo; Liability 1881-1887, which requires in all
industries precautions against accidents and reports of all serious
accidents to the cantonal governments, applies to mines. This led,
in 1896, to the creation of a special mining department, and mines, of
which there are few, have to be inspected once a year by a mining
engineer. The majority of the provisions of the Federal labour law
apply to adult workers of both sexes, and the general limit of the
11-hours&rsquo; day, exclusive of at least one hour for meals, applies to men
as well as women. The latter have, however, a legal claim, when
they have a household to manage, to leave work at the dinner-hour
half an hour earlier than the men. Men and unmarried women may
be employed in such subsidiary work as cleaning before or after the
general legal limits. On Saturdays and eves of the eight public
holidays the 11-hours&rsquo; day is reduced to 10. Sunday work and night
work are forbidden, but exceptions are permitted conditionally.
Night work is defined as 8 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> to 5 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> in summer, 8 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> to 6 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> in
winter. Children are excluded from employment in workplaces
under the law until 14 years of age, and until 16 must attend continuation
schools. Zürich canton has fixed the working day for
women at 10 hours generally, and 9 hours on Saturdays and eves of
holidays. Bâle-Ville canton has the same limits and provides that
the very limited Sunday employment permitted shall be compensated
by double time off on another day. In the German-speaking
cantons girls under 18 are not permitted to work overtime; in all
cantons except Glarus the conditional overtime of 2 hours must be
paid for at an enhanced wage.</p>

<p>Sanitary regulations and fencing of machinery are provided for
with considerable minuteness in a Federal decree of 1897. The plans
of every new factory must be submitted to the cantonal government.
In the case of lucifer match factories, not only the building
but methods of manufacture must be submitted. Since 1901 the
manufacture, sale and import of matches containing white phosphorus
have been forbidden. Women must be absent from employment
during eight weeks before and after childbirth. In certain dangerous
occupations, <i>e.g.</i> where lead or lead compounds are in use, women
may not legally be employed during pregnancy. A resolution of the
federal council in 1901 classed thirty-four different substances in use
in industry as dangerous and laid down that in case of clearly defined
illness of workers directly caused by use of any of these substances the
liability provided by article 3 of the law of the 25th of June 1881,
and article 1 of the law of the 26th of April 1887, should apply to the
manufacture. Legislative provision against abuses of the truck
system appears to be of earlier origin in Switzerland (17th century)
than any other European country outside England (15th century).
The Federal Labour Law 1877 generally prohibits payment of
wages otherwise than in current coin, and provides that no deduction
shall be made without an express contract. Some of the
cantonal laws go much farther than the British act of 1896 in forbidding
certain deductions; <i>e.g.</i> Zürich prohibits any charge for
cleaning, warming or lighting workrooms or for hire of machinery.
By the Federal law fines may not exceed half a day&rsquo;s wage. Administration
of the Labour laws is divided between inspectors
appointed by the Federal Government and local authorities, under
supervision of the cantonal governments. The Federal Government
forms a court of appeal against decisions of the cantonal
governments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span></p>

<p><i>Germany.</i>&mdash;Regulation of the conditions of labour in industry
throughout the German empire is provided for in the Imperial
Industrial Code and the orders of the Federal Council based thereon.
By far the most important recent amendment socially is the law
regulating child-labour, dated the 30th of March 1903, which relates
to establishments having industrial character in the sense of the
Industrial Code. This Code is based on earlier industrial codes of the
separate states, but more especially on the Code of 1869 of the
North German Confederation. It applies in whole or in part to all
trades and industrial occupations, except transport, fisheries and
agriculture. Mines are only included so far as truck, Sunday and
holiday rest, prohibition of employment underground of female
labour, limitation of the hours of women and young workers are
concerned; otherwise the regulations for protection of life and limb
of miners vary, as do the mining laws of the different states. To
estimate the force of the Industrial Code in working, it is necessary to
bear in mind the complicated political history of the empire, the
separate administration by the federated states, and the generally
considerable powers vested in administration of initiating regulations.
The Industrial Code expressly retains power for the states to
initiate certain additions or exceptions to the Code which in any
given state may form part of the law regulating factories there.
The Code (unlike the Austrian Industrial Code) lays down no general
limit for a normal working day for adult male workers, but since 1891
full powers were given to the Imperial government to limit hours for
any classes of workers in industries where excessive length of the
working day endangers the health of the worker (R.G.O. § 120<i>e</i>).
Previously application had been made of powers to reduce the working
day in such unhealthy industries as silvering of mirrors by mercury
and the manufacture of white-lead. Separate states had, under
mining laws, also limited hours of miners. Sunday rest was, in 1891,
secured for every class of workers, commercial, industrial and
mining. Annual holidays were also secured on church festivals.
These provisions, however, are subject to exceptions under conditions.
An important distinction has to be shown when we turn to
the regulations for hours and times of labour for protected persons
(women, young persons and children). Setting aside for the moment
hours of shop assistants (which are under special sections since 1900),
it is to &ldquo;factory workers&rdquo; and not to industrial workers in general
that these limits apply, although they may be, and in some instances
have been, further extended&mdash;for instance, in ready-made clothing
trades&mdash;by imperial decree to workshops, and by the Child Labour
Law of 1903 regulation of the scope and duration of employment of
children is much strengthened in workshops, commerce, transport
and domestic industries. The term &ldquo;factory&rdquo; (<i>Fabrik</i>) is not defined
in the Code, but it is clear from various decisions of the supreme
court that it only in part coincides with the English term, and that
some workplaces, where processes are carried on by aid of mechanical
power, rank rather as English workshops. The distinction is rather
between wholesale manufacturing industry, with subdivision of
labour, and small industry, where the employer works himself.
Certain classes of undertaking, viz. forges, timber-yards, dockyards,
brickfields and open quarries, are specifically ranked as
factories. Employment of protected persons at the surface of mines
and underground quarries, and in salt works and ore-dressing works,
and of boys underground comes under the factory regulations.
These exclude children from employment under 13 years, and even
later if an educational certificate has not been obtained; until 14
years hours of employment may not exceed 6 in the 24. In processes
and occupations under the scope of the Child Labour Law children
may not be employed by their parents or guardians before 10 years
of age or by other employers before 12 years of age; nor between
the hours of 8 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> and 8 <span class="scs">A.M.</span>, nor otherwise than in full compliance
with requirements of educational authorities for school attendance
and with due regard to prescribed pauses. In school term time the
daily limit of employment for children is three hours, in holiday time
three hours. As regards factories Germany, unlike Great Britain,
France and Switzerland, requires a shorter day for young persons
than for women&mdash;10 hours for the former, 11 hours for the latter.
Women over 16 years may be employed 11 hours. Night work is
forbidden, <i>i.e.</i> work between 8.30 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> and 5.30 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> Overtime may
be granted to meet unforeseen pressure or for work on perishable
articles, under conditions, by local authorities and the higher administrative
authorities. Prescribed meal-times are&mdash;an unbroken
half-hour for children in their 6 hours; for young persons a mid-day
pause of one hour, and half an hour respectively in the morning and
afternoon spells; for women, an hour at mid-day, but women with
the care of a household have the claim, on demand, to an extra half-hour,
as in Switzerland. No woman may be employed within four
weeks after childbirth, and unless a medical certificate can then be
produced, the absence must extend to six weeks. Notice of working
periods and meal-times must be affixed, and copies sent to the local
authorities. Employment of protected persons in factory industries
where there are special risks to health or morality may be forbidden
or made dependent on special conditions. By the Child Labour Law
employment of children is forbidden in brickworks, stone breaking,
chimney sweeping, street cleaning and other processes and occupations.
By an order of the Federal Council in 1902 female workers
were excluded from main processes in forges and rolling mills. All
industrial employers alike are bound to organize labour in such a
manner as to secure workers against injury to health and to ensure
good conduct and propriety. Sufficient light, suitable cloakrooms
and sanitary accommodation, and ventilation to carry off dust,
vapours and other impurities are especially required. Dining-rooms
may be ordered by local authorities. Fencing and provision
for safety in case of fire are required in detail. The work of the
trade accident insurance associations in preventing accidents is
especially recognized in provisions for special rules in dangerous or
unhealthy industries. Officials of the state factory departments are
bound to give opportunity to trustees of the trade associations to
express an opinion on special rules. In a large number of industries
the Federal Council has laid down special rules comparable with those
for unhealthy occupations in Great Britain. Among the regulations
most recently revised and strengthened are those for manufacture of
lead colours and lead compounds, and for horse-hair and brush-making
factories. The relations between the state inspectors of
factories and the ordinary police authorities are regulated in each
state by its constitution. Prohibitions of truck in its original sense&mdash;that
is, payment of wages otherwise than in current coin&mdash;apply to
any persons under a contract of service with an employer for a
specified time for industrial purposes; members of a family working
for a parent or husband are not included; outworkers are covered.
Control of fines and deductions from wages applies only in factory
industries and shops employing at least 20 workers. Shop hours
are regulated by requiring shops to be closed generally between
9 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> and 5 <span class="scs">A.M.</span>, by requiring a fixed mid-day rest of 1½ hours and
at least 10 hours&rsquo; rest in the 24 for assistants. These limits can be
modified by administrative authority. Notice of hours and working
rules must be affixed. During the hours of compulsory closing sale
of goods on the streets or from house to house is forbidden. Under
the Commercial Code, as under the Civil Code, every employer is
bound to adopt every possible measure for maintaining the safety,
health and good conduct of his employés. By an order of the
Imperial Chancellor under the Commercial Code seats must be provided
for commercial assistants and apprentices.</p>

<p><i>Austria.</i>&mdash;The Industrial Code of Austria, which in its present
outline (modified by later enactments) dates from 1883, must be
carefully distinguished from the Industrial Code of the kingdom
of Hungary. The latter is, owing to the predominantly agricultural
character of the population, of later origin, and hardly had practical
force before the law of 1893 provided for inspection and prevention
of accidents in factories. No separate mining code exists in
Hungary, and conditions of labour are regulated by the Austrian
law of 1854. The truck system is repressed on lines similar to those
in Austria and Germany. As regards limitation of hours of adult
labour, Hungary may be contrasted with both those empires in that
no restriction of hours applies either to men&rsquo;s or women&rsquo;s hours,
whereas in Austrian factories both are limited to an 11-hours&rsquo; day
with exceptional overtime for which payment must always be made
to the worker. The Austrian Code has its origin, however, like the
British Factory Acts, in protection of child labour. Its present scope
is determined by the Imperial &ldquo;Patent&rdquo; of 1859, and all industrial
labour is included except mining, transport, fisheries, forestry,
agriculture and domestic industries. Factories are defined as
including industries in which a &ldquo;manufacturing process is carried on
in an enclosed place by the aid of not less than twenty workers
working with machines, with subdivision of labour, and under
an employer who does not himself manually assist in the work.&rdquo;
In smaller handicraft industries the compulsory gild system of
organization still applies. In every industrial establishment, large
or small, the sanitary and safety provisions, general requirement
of Sunday rest, and annual holidays (with conditional exceptions),
prohibition of truck and limitation of the ages of child labour apply.
Night work for women, 8 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> to 5 <span class="scs">A.M.</span>, is prohibited only in factory
industries; for young workers it is prohibited in any industry.
Pauses in work are required in all industries; one hour at least must
be given at mid-day, and if the morning and afternoon spells exceed
5 hours each, another half-hour&rsquo;s rest at least must be given. Children
may not be employed in industrial work before 12 years, and then
only 8 hours a day at work that is not injurious and if educational
requirements are observed. The age of employment is raised to 14
for &ldquo;factories,&rdquo; and the work must be such as will not hinder physical
development. Women may not be employed in regular industrial
occupation within one month after childbirth. In certain scheduled
unhealthy industries, where certificates of authorization from local
authorities must be obtained by intending occupiers, conditions of
health and safety for workers can be laid down in the certificate.
The Minister of the Interior is empowered to draw up regulations
prohibiting or making conditions for the employment of young
workers or women in dangerous or unhealthy industries. The provisions
against truck cover not only all industrial workers engaged in
manual labour under a contract with an employer, but also shop-assistants;
the special regulations against fines and deductions apply
to factory workers and shops where at least 20 workers are employed.
In mines under the law of 1884, which supplements the general
mining law, employment of women and girls underground is prohibited;
boys from 12 to 16 and girls from 12 to 18 may only be
employed at light work above ground; 14 is the earliest age of
admission for boys underground. The shifts from bank to bank must
not exceed 12 hours, of which not more than 10 may be effective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
work. Sunday rest must begin not later than 6 <span class="scs">A.M.</span>, and must be of
24 hours&rsquo; duration. These last two provisions do not hold in case of
pressing danger for safety, health or property. Sick and accident
funds and mining associations are legislated for in minutest detail.
The general law provides for safety in working, but special rules
drawn up by the district authorities lay down in detail the conditions
of health and safety. As regards manufacturing industry, the
Industrial Code lays no obligation on employers to report accidents,
and until the Accident Insurance Law of 1889 came into force
no statistics were available. In Austria, unlike Germany, the factory
inspectorate is organized throughout under a central chief inspector.</p>

<p><i>Scandinavian Countries.</i>&mdash;In Sweden the Factory Law was
amended in January 1901; in Denmark in July 1901. Until that
year, however, Norway was in some respects in advance of the other
two countries by its law of 1892, which applied to industrial works,
including metal works of all kinds and mining. Women were thereby
prohibited from employment: (<i>a</i>) underground; (<i>b</i>) in cleaning or
oiling machinery in motion; (<i>c</i>) during six weeks after childbirth,
unless provided with a medical certificate stating that they might
return at the end of four weeks without injury to health; (<i>d</i>) in
dangerous, unhealthy or exhausting trades during pregnancy.
Further, work on Sundays and public holidays is prohibited to all
workers, adult and youthful, with conditional exceptions under the
authority of the inspectors. Children over 12 are admitted to
industrial work on obtaining certificates of birth, of physical fitness
and of elementary education. The hours of children are limited to
6, with pauses, and of young persons (of 14 to 18 years) to 10, with
pauses. Night work between 8 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> and 6 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> is prohibited. All
workers are entitled to a copy of a code of factory rules containing the
terms of the contract of work drawn up by representatives of employés
with the employers and sanctioned by the inspector. Health and
safety in working are provided for in detail in the same law of 1892.
Special rules may be made for dangerous trades, and in 1899 such
rules were established for match factories, similar to some of the
British rules, but notably providing for a dental examination four
times yearly by a doctor. In Denmark, regulation began with unhealthy
industries, and it was not until the law of 1901 came into
force, on the 1st of January 1902, that children under 12 years have
been excluded from factory labour. Control of child labour can be
strengthened by municipal regulation, and this has been done in
Copenhagen by an order of the 23rd of May 1903. In Sweden the
12 years&rsquo; limit had for some time held in the larger factories; the
scope has been extended so that it corresponds with the Norwegian
law. The hours of children are, in Denmark, 6½ for those under 14
years; in Sweden 6 for those under 13 years. Young persons may
not in either country work more than 10 hours daily, and night work,
which is forbidden for persons under 18 years, is now defined as in
Norway. Women may not be employed in industry within four
weeks of childbirth, except on authority of a medical certificate. All
factories in Sweden where young workers are employed are subject to
medical inspection once a year. Fencing of machinery and hygienic
conditions (ventilation, cubic space, temperature, light) are regulated
in detail. In Denmark the use of white phosphorus in manufacture
of lucifer matches has been prohibited since 1874, and special regulations
have been drawn up by administrative orders which strengthen
control of various unhealthy or dangerous industries, <i>e.g.</i> dry-cleaning
works, printing works and type foundries, iron foundries and engineering
works. A special act of the 6th of April 1906 regulates labour
and sanitary conditions in bakehouses and confectionery works.</p>

<p><i>Italy and Spain.</i>&mdash;The wide difference between the industrial
development of these southern Latin countries and the two countries
with which this summary begins, and the far greater importance of
the agricultural interests, produced a situation, as regards labour
legislation until as recently as 1903, which makes it convenient to
touch on the comparatively limited scope of their regulations at the
close of the series. It was stated by competent and impartial observers
from each of the two countries, at the International Congress
on Labour Laws held at Brussels in 1897, that the lack of adequate
measures for protection of child labour and inefficient administration
of such regulations as exist was then responsible for abuse of their
forces that could be found in no other European countries. &ldquo;Their
labour in factories, workshops, and mines constitutes a veritable
martyrdom&rdquo; (Spain). &ldquo;I believe that there is no country where
a sacrifice of child life is made that is comparable with that in certain
Italian factories and industries&rdquo; (Italy). In both countries important
progress has since been made in organizing inspection and
preventing accidents. In Spain the first step in the direction of
limitation of women&rsquo;s hours of labour was taken by a law of 1900,
which took effect in 1902, in regulations for reduction of hours of
labour for adults to 11, normally, in the 24. Hours of children under
14 must not exceed 6 in any industrial work nor 8 in any commercial
undertaking. Labour before the age of 10 years and night work
between 6 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> and 5 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> was prohibited, and powers were taken to
extend the prohibition of night work to young persons under 16 years.
The labour of children in Italy was until 1902 regulated in the main
by a law of 1886, but a royal decree of 1899 strengthened it by
classing night work for children under 12 years as &ldquo;injurious,&rdquo; such
work being thereby generally prohibited for them, though exceptions
are admitted; at the same time it was laid down that children from
12 to 15 years might not be employed for more than 6 hours at night.
The law of 1886 prohibits employment of children under 9 years in
industry and under 10 years in underground mining. Night work
for women was in Italy first prohibited by the law of the 19th of June
1902, and at the same time also for boys under 15, but this regulation
was not to take full effect for 5 years as regards persons already so
employed; by the same law persons under 15 and women of any age
were accorded the claim to one day&rsquo;s complete rest of 24 hours in the
week; the age of employment of children in factories, workshops,
laboratories, quarries, mines, was raised to 12 years generally and 14
years for underground work; the labour of female workers of any
age was prohibited in underground work, and power was reserved to
further restrict and regulate their employment as well as that of male
workers under 15. Spain and Italy, the former by the law of the
13th of March 1900, the latter by the law of the 19th of June 1902,
prohibit the employment of women within a fixed period of childbirth;
in Spain the limit is three weeks, in Italy one month, which
may be reduced to three weeks on a medical certificate of fitness.
Sunday rest is secured in industrial works, with regulated exceptions
in Spain by the law of the 3rd of March 1904. It is in the
direction of fencing and other safeguards against accidents and as
regards sanitary provisions, both in industrial workplaces and in
mines, that Italy has made most advance since her law of 1890 for
prevention of accidents. Special measures for prevention of malaria
are required in cultivation of rice by a ministerial circular of the 23rd
of April 1903; work may not begin until an hour after sunrise and
must cease an hour before sunset; children under 13 may not be
employed in this industry.</p>

<p>Under the general head of Labour Legislation all American
statute laws regulating labour, its conditions, and the relation
of employer and employé must be classed. It includes
what is properly known as factory legislation. Labour
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
legislation belongs to the latter half of the 19th century, so far
as the United States is concerned. Like England in the far past,
the Americans in colonial days undertook to regulate wages
and prices, and later the employment of apprentices. Legislation
relating to wages and prices was long ago abandoned, but the
laws affecting the employment of apprentices still exist in some
form, although conditions of employment have changed so
materially that apprenticeships are not entered as of old; but
the laws regulating the employment of apprentices were the
basis on which English legislation found a foothold when
parliament wished to regulate the labour of factory operatives.
The code of labour laws of the present time is almost entirely
the result of the industrial revolution during the latter part of
the 18th century, under which the domestic or hand-labour
system was displaced through the introduction of power
machinery. As this revolution took place in the United States
at a somewhat later date than in England, the labour legislation
necessitated by it belongs to a later date. The factory, so far
as textiles are concerned, was firmly established in America
during the period from 1820 to 1840, and it was natural that the
English legislation found friends and advocates in the United
States, although the more objectionable conditions accompanying
the English factory were not to be found there.</p>

<p>The first attempt to secure legislation regulating factory
employment related to the hours of labour, which were very long&mdash;from
twelve to thirteen hours a day. As machinery
was introduced it was felt that the tension resulting
<span class="sidenote">Early attempts to regulate hours.</span>
from speeded machines and the close attention required
in the factory ought to be accompanied by a
shorter work-day. This view took firm hold of the operatives,
and was the chief cause of the agitation which has resulted in a
great body of laws applying in very many directions. As early
as 1806 the caulkers and shipbuilders of New York City agitated
for a reduction of hours to ten per day, but no legislation followed.
There were several other attempts to secure some regulation
relative to hours, but there was no general agitation prior to 1831.
As Massachusetts was the state which first recognized the necessity
of regulating employment (following in a measure, and so far as
conditions demanded, the English labour or factory legislation),
the history of such legislation in that state is indicative of that
in the United States, and as it would be impossible in this article
to give a detailed history of the origin of laws in the different
states, the dates of their enactment, and their provisions, it is
best to follow primarily the course of the Eastern states, and
especially that of Massachusetts, where the first general agitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
took place and the first laws were enacted. That state in 1836
regulated by law the question of the education of young persons
employed in manufacturing establishments. The regulation of
hours of labour was warmly discussed in 1832, and several
legislative committees and commissions reported upon it, but no
specific action on the general question of hours of labour secured
the indorsement of the Massachusetts legislature until 1874,
although the day&rsquo;s labour of children under twelve years of age
was limited to ten hours in 1842. Ten hours constituted a day&rsquo;s
labour, on a voluntary basis, in many trades in Massachusetts
and other parts of the country as early as 1853, while in the
shipbuilding trades this was the work-day in 1844. In April
1840 President Van Buren issued an order &ldquo;that all public
establishments will hereafter be regulated, as to working hours,
by the ten-hours system.&rdquo; The real aggressive movement began
in 1845, through numerous petitions to the Massachusetts
legislature urging a reduction of the day&rsquo;s labour to eleven hours,
but nothing came of these petitions at that time. Again, in 1850,
a similar effort was made, and also in 1851 and 1852, but the bills
failed. Then there was a period of quiet until 1865, when an
unpaid commission made a report relative to the hours of labour,
and recommended the establishment of a bureau of statistics
for the purpose of collecting data bearing upon the labour
question. This was the first step in this direction in any country.
The first bureau of the kind was established in Massachusetts in
1869, but meanwhile, in accordance with reports of commissions
and the address of Governor Bullock in 1866, and the general
sentiment which then prevailed, the legislature passed an act
regulating in a measure the conditions of the employment of
children in manufacturing establishments; and this is one of
the first laws of the kind in the United States, although the first
legislation in the United States relating to the hours of labour
which the writer has been able to find, and for which he can fix
a date, was enacted by the state of Pennsylvania in 1849, the law
providing that ten hours should be a day&rsquo;s work in cotton,
woollen, paper, bagging, silk and flax factories.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts law of 1866 provided, firstly, that no child
under ten should be employed in any manufacturing establishment,
and that no child between ten and fourteen
should be so employed unless he had attended some
<span class="sidenote">Employment of children.</span>
public or private school at least six months during the
year preceding such employment, and, further, that
such employment should not continue unless the child attended
school at least six months in each and every year; secondly, a
penalty not exceeding $50 for every owner or agent or other person
knowingly employing a child in violation of the act; thirdly,
that no child under the age of fourteen should be employed in any
manufacturing establishment more than eight hours in any one
day; fourthly, that any parent or guardian allowing or consenting
to employment in violation of the act should forfeit a sum
not to exceed $50 for each offence; fifthly, that the Governor
instruct the state constable and his deputies to enforce the
provisions of all laws for regulating the employment of children
in manufacturing establishments. The same legislature also
created a commission of three persons, whose duty it was to
investigate the subject of hours of labour in relation to the
social, educational and sanitary condition of the working classes.
In 1867 a fundamental law relating to schooling and hours of
labour of children employed in manufacturing and mechanical
establishments was passed by the Massachusetts legislature.
It differed from the act of the year previous in some respects,
going deeper into the general question. It provided that no
child under ten should be employed in any manufacturing or
mechanical establishment of the commonwealth, and that no
child between ten and fifteen should be so employed unless he
had attended school, public or private, at least three months
during the year next preceding his employment. There were
provisions relating to residence, &amp;c., and a further provision that
no time less than 120 half-days of actual schooling should be
deemed an equivalent of three months, and that no child under
fifteen should be employed in any manufacturing or mechanical
establishment more than sixty hours any one week. The law
also provided penalties for violation. It repealed the act of
1866.</p>

<p>In 1869 began the establishment of that chain of offices in
the United States, the principle of which has been adopted by
other countries, known as bureaus of statistics of labour,
their especial purpose being the collection and dissemination of
information relating to all features of industrial employment.
As a result of the success of the first bureau, bureaus are in
existence in thirty-three states, in addition to the United States
Bureau of Labour.</p>

<p>A special piece of legislation which belongs to the commonwealth
of Massachusetts, so far as experience shows, was that
in 1872, providing for cheap morning and evening trains for the
accommodation of working men living in the vicinity of Boston.
Great Britain had long had such trains, which were called
parliamentary trains. Under the Massachusetts law some of the
railways running out of Boston furnished the accommodation
required, and the system has since been in operation.</p>

<p>In different parts of the country the agitation to secure legislation
regulating the hours of labour became aggressive again
in 1870 and the years immediately following, there
being a constant repetition of attempts to secure the
<span class="sidenote">Factory legislation, 1877.</span>
enactment of a ten-hours law, but in Massachusetts
all the petitions failed till 1874, when the legislature of
that commonwealth established the hours of labour at sixty per
week not only for children under eighteen, but for women, the
law providing that no minor under eighteen and no woman over
that age should be employed by any person, firm or corporation
in any manufacturing establishment more than ten hours in any
one day. In 1876 Massachusetts reconstructed its laws relating
to the employment of children, although it did not abrogate the
principles involved in earlier legislation, while in 1877 the
commonwealth passed Factory Acts covering the general provisions
of the British laws. It provided for the general inspection
of factories and public buildings, the provisions of the law
relating to dangerous machinery, such as belting, shafting, gearing,
drums, &amp;c., which the legislature insisted must be securely
guarded, and that no machinery other than steam engines should
be cleaned while running. The question of ventilation and
cleanliness was also attended to. Dangers connected with
hoistways, elevators and well-holes were minimized by their
protection by sufficient trap-doors, while fire-escapes were made
obligatory on all establishments of three or more storeys in
height. All main doors, both inside and outside, of manufacturing
establishments, as well as those of churches, school-rooms,
town halls, theatres and every building used for public assemblies,
should open outwardly whenever the factory inspectors of the
commonwealth deemed it necessary. These provisions remain
in the laws of Massachusetts, and other states have found it wise
to follow them.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The labour legislation in force in 1910 in the various states of the
Union might be classified in two general branches: (A) protective
labour legislation, or laws for the aid of workers who, on account of
their economic dependence, are not in a position fully to protect
themselves; (B) legislation having for its purpose the fixing of the
legal status of the worker as an employé, such as laws relating to the
making and breaking of the labour contract, the right to form
organizations and to assemble peaceably, the settlement of labour
disputes, the licensing of occupations, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(A) The first class includes factory and workshop acts, laws relating
to hours of labour, work on Sundays and holidays, the payment of
wages, the liability of employers for injuries to their
employés, &amp;c. Factory acts have been passed by
<span class="sidenote">Factory and workshop acts.</span>
nearly all the states of the Union. These may be
considered in two groups&mdash;first, laws which relate to conditions
of employment and affect only children, young persons and
women; and second, laws which relate to the sanitary condition of
factories and workshops and to the safety of employés generally.
The states adopting such laws have usually made provision for
factory inspectors, whose duties are to enforce these laws and who
have power to enter and inspect factories and workshops. The most
common provisions of the factory acts in the various states are those
which fix an age limit below which employment is unlawful. All but
five states have enacted such provisions, and these five states have
practically no manufacturing industries. In some states the laws
fixing an age limit are restricted in their application to factories,
while in others they extend also to workshops, bakeries, mercantile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
establishments and other work places where children are employed.
The prescribed age limit varies from ten to fourteen years. Provisions
concerning the education of children in factories and workshops may
be considered in two groups, those relating to apprenticeship and
those requiring a certain educational qualification as a pre-requisite
to employment. Apprenticeship laws are numerous, but they do not
now have great force, because of the practical abrogation of the
apprenticeship system through the operation of modern methods
of production. Most states have provisions prohibiting illiterates
under a specified age, usually sixteen, from being employed in
factories and workshops. The provisions of the factory acts relating
to hours of labour and night work generally affect only the employment
of women and young persons. Most of the states have enacted
such provisions, those limiting the hours of children occurring more
frequently than those limiting the hours of women. The hour limit
for work in such cases ranges from six per day to sixty-six per week.
Where the working time of children is restricted, the minimum age
prescribed for such children ranges from twelve to twenty-one years.
In some cases the restriction of the hours of labour of women and
children is general, while in others it applies only to employment in
one or more classes of industries. Other provisions of law for the
protection of women and children, but not usually confined in their
operation to factories and workshops, are such as require seats for
females and separate toilet facilities for the sexes, and prohibit employment
in certain occupations as in mines, places where intoxicants
are manufactured or sold, in cleaning or operating dangerous
machinery, &amp;c. Provisions of factory acts relating to the sanitary
condition of factories and workshops and the safety of employés
have been enacted in nearly all the manufacturing states of the
Union. They prohibit overcrowding, and require proper ventilation,
sufficient light and heat, the lime-washing or painting of walls
and ceilings, the provision of exhaust fans and blowers in places where
dust or dangerous fumes are generated, guards on machinery,
mechanical belts and gearing shifters, guards on elevators and hoistways,
hand-rails on stairs, fire-escapes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The statutes relating to hours of labour may be considered under
five groups, namely: (1) general laws which merely fix what shall
be regarded as a day&rsquo;s labour in the absence of a contract;
(2) laws defining what shall constitute a day&rsquo;s work on
<span class="sidenote">Hours of labour.</span>
public roads; (3) laws limiting the hours of labour per
day on public works; (4) laws limiting the hours of labour in certain
occupations; and (5) laws which specify the hours per day or per
week during which women and children may be employed. The
statutes included in the first two groups place no restrictions upon
the number of hours which may be agreed upon between employers
and employés, while those in the other three groups usually limit the
freedom of contract and provide penalties for their violation. A
considerable number of states have enacted laws which fix a day&rsquo;s
labour in the absence of any contract, some at eight and others at
ten hours, so that when an employer and an employé make a contract
and they do not specify what shall constitute a day&rsquo;s labour, eight
or ten hours respectively would be ruled as the day&rsquo;s labour in an
action which might come before the courts. In a number of the states
it is optional with the citizens to liquidate certain taxes either by
cash payments or by rendering personal service. In the latter case
the length of the working day is defined by law, eight hours being
usually specified. The Federal government and nearly one-half of the
states have laws providing that eight hours shall constitute a day&rsquo;s
work for employés on public works. Under the Federal Act it is
unlawful for any officer of the government or of any contractor or
sub-contractor for public works to permit labourers and mechanics to
work longer than eight hours per day. The state laws concerning
hours of labour have similar provisions. Exceptions are provided
for cases of extraordinary emergencies, such as danger to human life
or property. In many states the hours of labour have been limited
by law in occupations in which, on account of their dangerous or
insanitary character, the health of the employés would be jeopardized
by long hours of labour, or in which the fatigue occasioned by long
hours would endanger the lives of the employés or of the public.
The occupations for which such special legislation has been enacted
are those of employés on steam and street railways, in mines and
other underground workings, smelting and refining works, bakeries
and cotton and woollen mills. Laws limiting the hours of labour of
women and children have been considered under factory and workshop
acts.</p>

<p>Nearly all states and Territories of the Union have laws prohibiting
the employment of labour on Sunday. These laws usually make it
<span class="sidenote">Sunday labour.</span>
a misdemeanour for persons either to labour themselves or
to compel or permit their apprentices, servants or other
employés, to labour on the first day of the week. Exceptions
are made in the case of household duties or works of
necessity or charity, and in the case of members of religious societies
who observe some other than the first day of the week.</p>

<p>Statutes concerning the payment of wages of employés may be
considered in two groups: (1) those which relate to the employment
contract, such as laws fixing the maximum period of wage
payments, prohibiting the payment of wages in scrip or
<span class="sidenote">Payment of wages.</span>
other evidences of indebtedness in lieu of lawful money,
prohibiting wage deductions on account of fines, breakage of
machinery, discounts for prepayments, medical attendance, relief
funds or other purposes, requiring the giving of notice of reduction of
wages, &amp;c.; (2) legislation granting certain privileges or affording
special protection to working people with respect to their wages,
such as laws exempting wages from attachment, preferring wage
claims in assignments, and granting workmen liens upon buildings
and other constructions on which they have been employed.</p>

<p>Employers&rsquo; liability laws have been passed to enable an employé
to recover damages from his employer under certain conditions when
he has been injured through accident occurring in the
works of the employer. The common-law maxim that the
<span class="sidenote">Employers&rsquo; liability.</span>
principal is responsible for the acts of his agent does not
apply where two or more persons are working together under
the same employer and one of the employés is injured through the
carelessness of his fellow-employé, although the one causing the
accident is the agent of the principal, who under the common law
would be responsible. The old Roman law and the English and
American practice under it held that the co-employé was a party to
the accident. The injustice of this rule is seen by a single illustration.
A weaver in a cotton factory, where there are hundreds of operatives,
is injured by the neglect or carelessness of the engineer in charge of
the motive power. Under the common law the weaver could not
recover damages from the employer, because he was the co-employé
of the engineer. So, one of thousands of employés of a railway
system, sustaining injuries through the carelessness of a switchman
whom he never saw, could recover no damages from the railway
company, both being co-employés of the same employer. The
injustice of this application of the common-law rule has been recognized,
but the only way to avoid the difficulty was through specific
legislation providing that under such conditions as those related,
and similar ones, the doctrine of co-employment should not apply,
and that the workman should have the same right to recover damages
as a passenger upon a railway train. This legislation has upset some
of the most notable distinctions of law.</p>

<p>The first agitation for legislation of this character occurred in
England in 1880. A number of states in the Union have now
enacted statutes fixing the liability of employers under certain
conditions and relieving the employé from the application of the
common-law rule. Where the employé himself is contributory to
the injuries resulting from an accident he cannot recover, nor can he
recover in some cases where he knows of the danger from the defects
of tools or implements employed by him. The legislation upon the
subject involves many features of legislation which need not be
described here, such as those concerning the power of employés to
make a contract, and those defining the conditions, often elaborate,
which lead to the liability of the employer and the duties of the
employé, and the relations in which damages for injuries sustained
in employment may be recovered from the employer.</p>

<p>(B) The statutes thus far considered may be regarded as protective
labour legislation. There is, besides, a large body of statutory laws
enacted in the various states for the purpose of fixing the legal status
of employers and employés and defining their rights and privileges
as such.</p>

<p>A great variety of statutes have been enacted in the various
states relating to the labour contract. Among these are laws defining
the labour contract, requiring notice of termination
of contract, making it a misdemeanour to break a contract
<span class="sidenote">Labour contract.</span>
of service and thereby endanger human life or expose
valuable property to serious injury, or to make a contract of service
and accept transportation or pecuniary advancements with intent to
defraud, prohibiting contracts of employment whereby employés
waive the right to damages in case of injury, &amp;c. A Federal statute
makes it a misdemeanour for any one to prepay the transportation or
in any way assist or encourage the importation of aliens under
contract to perform labour or service of any kind in the United States,
exceptions being made in the case of skilled labour that cannot
otherwise be obtained, domestic servants and persons belonging to
any of the recognized professions.</p>

<p>The Federal government and nearly all the states and territories
have statutory provisions requiring the examination and licensing
of persons practising certain trades other than those in the
class of recognized professions. The Federal statute relates
<span class="sidenote">Licensed occupations.</span>
only to engineers on steam vessels, masters, mates,
pilots, &amp;c. The occupations for which examinations and
licences are required by the various state laws are those of barbers,
horseshoers, elevator operators, plumbers, stationary firemen, steam
engineers, telegraph operators on railroads and certain classes of
mine workers and steam and street railway employés.</p>
</div>

<p>The right of combination and peaceable assembly on the part
of employés is recognized at common law throughout the United
States. Organizations of working-men formed for
their mutual benefit, protection and improvement,
<span class="sidenote">Labour organizations.</span>
such as for endeavouring to secure higher wages,
shorter hours of labour or better working conditions,
are nowhere regarded as unlawful. A number of states and the
Federal government have enacted statutes providing for the
incorporation of trade unions, but owing to the freedom from
regulation or inspection enjoyed by unincorporated trade unions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
very few have availed themselves of this privilege. A number of
states have enacted laws tending to give special protection to
and encourage trade unions. Thus, nearly one-half of the states
have passed acts declaring it unlawful for employers to discharge
workmen for joining labour organizations, or to make it a condition
of employment that they shall not belong to such bodies.
Laws of this kind have generally been held to be unconstitutional.
Nearly all the states have laws protecting trade
unions in the use of the union label, insignia of membership,
credentials, &amp;c., and making it a misdemeanour to counterfeit
or fraudulently use them. A number of the states exempt
labour organizations from the operations of the anti-trust and
insurance acts.</p>

<p>Until recent years all legal action concerning labour disturbances
was based upon the principles of the common law.
Some of the states have now fairly complete statutory
enactments concerning labour disturbances, while
<span class="sidenote">Labour disputes.</span>
others have little or no legislation of this class. The
right of employés to strike for any cause or for no cause is sustained
by the common law everywhere in the United States.
Likewise an employer has a right to discharge any or all of his
employés when they have no contract with him, and he may
refuse to employ any person or class of persons for any reason
or for no reason. Agreements among strikers to take peaceable
means to induce others to remain away from the works of an
employer until he yields to the demands of the strikers are
not held to be conspiracies under the common law, and the
carrying out of such a purpose by peaceable persuasion and
without violence, intimidation or threats, is not unlawful.
However, any interference with the constitutional rights of
another to employ whom he chooses or to labour when, where
or on what terms he pleases, is illegal. The boycott has been
held to be an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade. The
statutory enactments of the various states concerning labour
disturbances are in part re-enactments of the rules of common law
and in part more or less departures from or additions to the
established principles. The list of such statutory enactments is
a large one, and includes laws relating to blacklisting, boycotting,
conspiracy against working-men, interference with
employment, intimidation, picketing and strikes of railway
employés; laws requiring statements of causes of discharge of
employés and notice of strikes in advertisements for labour;
laws prohibiting deception in the employment of labour and the
hiring of armed guards by employers; and laws declaring that
certain labour agreements do not constitute conspiracy. Some of
these laws have been held to be unconstitutional, and some have
not yet been tested in the courts.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The laws just treated relate almost entirely to acts either of
employers or of employés, but there is another form of law, namely,
that providing for action to be taken by others in the effort
to prevent working people from losing employment, either
<span class="sidenote">Arbitration and conciliation.</span>
by their own acts or by those of their employers, or to
settle any differences which arise out of controversies
relating to wages, hours of labour, terms and conditions
of employment, rules, &amp;c. These laws provide for the mediation and
the arbitration of labour disputes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arbitration and Conciliation</a></span>).
Twenty-three states and the Federal government have laws
or constitutional provisions of this nature. In some cases they provide
for the appointment of state boards, and in others of local boards
only. A number of states provide for local or special boards in
addition to the regular state boards. In some states it is required
that a member of a labour organization must be a member of the
board, and, in general, both employers and employés must be
represented. Nearly all state boards are required to attempt to
mediate between the parties to a dispute when information is received
of an actual or threatened labour trouble. Arbitration may
be undertaken in some states on application from either party, in
others on the application of both parties. An agreement to maintain
the <i>status quo</i> pending arbitration is usually required. The modes of
enforcement of obedience to the awards of the boards are various.
Some states depend on publicity alone, some give the decisions the
effect of judgments of courts of law which may be enforced by
execution, while in other states disobedience to such decisions is
punishable as for contempt of court. The Federal statute applies
only to common carriers engaged in interstate commerce, and provides
for an attempt to be made at mediation by two designated government
officials in controversies between common carriers and their
employés, and, in case of the failure of such an attempt, for the
formation of a board of arbitration consisting of the same officials
together with certain other parties to be selected. Such arbitration
boards are to be formed only at the request or upon the consent of
both parties to the controversy.</p>
</div>

<p>The enforcement of laws by executive or judicial action is an
important matter relating to labour legislation, for without
action such laws would remain dead letters. Under
the constitutions of the states, the governor is the
<span class="sidenote">The judicial enforcement of labour laws.</span>
commander-in-chief of the military forces, and he has
the power to order the militia or any part of it into
active service in case of insurrection, invasion, tumult,
riots or breaches of the peace or imminent danger
thereof. Frequent action has been taken in the case of strikes
with the view of preventing or suppressing violence threatened or
happening to persons or property, the effect being, however, that
the militia protects those working or desiring to work, or the
employers. The president of the United States may use the
land and naval forces whenever by reason of insurrection,
domestic violence, unlawful obstructions, conspiracy, combinations
or assemblages of persons it becomes impracticable to
enforce the laws of the land by the ordinary course of judicial
proceedings, or when the execution of the laws is so hindered
by reason of such events that any portion or class of the people
are deprived thereby of their rights and privileges under the
constitution and laws of the country. Under this general power
the United States forces have been used for the protection of
both employers and employés indirectly, the purpose being to
protect mails and, as in the states, to see that the laws are carried
out.</p>

<p>The power of the courts to interfere in labour disputes is
through the injunction and punishment thereunder for contempt
of court. It is a principle of law that when there are interferences,
actual or threatened, with property or with rights of a pecuniary
nature, and the common or statute law offers no adequate and
immediate remedy for the prevention of injury, a court of equity
may interpose and issue its order or injunction as to what must
or must not be done, a violation of which writ gives the court
which issued it the power to punish for contempt. The doctrine
is that something is necessary to be done to stop at once the
destruction of property and the obstruction of business, and the
injunction is immediate in its action. This writ has been resorted
to frequently for the indirect protection of employés and of
employers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABOUR PARTY,<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> in Great Britain, the name given to the
party in parliament composed of working-class representatives.
As the result of the Reform Act of 1884, extending the franchise
to a larger new working-class electorate, the votes of &ldquo;labour&rdquo;
became more and more a matter of importance for politicians;
and the Liberal party, seeking for the support of organized
labour in the trade unions, found room for a few working-class
representatives, who, however, acted and voted as Liberals.
It was not till 1893 that the Independent Labour party, splitting
off under Mr J. Keir Hardie (b. 1856) from the socialist organization
known as the Social Democratic Federation (founded 1881),
was formed at Bradford, with the object of getting independent
candidates returned to parliament on a socialist programme.
In 1900 Mr Keir Hardie, who as secretary of the Lanarkshire
Miners&rsquo; Union had stood unsuccessfully as a labour candidate
for Mid-Lanark in 1888, and sat as M.P. for West Ham in
1892-1895, was elected to parliament for Merthyr-Tydvil by its
efforts, and in 1906 it obtained the return of 30 members, Mr
Keir Hardie being chairman of the group. Meanwhile in 1899
the Trade Union Congress instructed its parliamentary committee
to call a conference on the question of labour representation;
and in February 1900 this was attended by trade union
delegates and also by representatives of the Independent Labour
party, the Social Democratic Federation and the Fabian Society.
A resolution was carried &ldquo;to establish a distinct labour group
in parliament, who shall have their own whips, and agree upon
their own policy, which must embrace a readiness to co-operate
with any party which for the time being may be engaged in
promoting legislation in the direct interest of labour,&rdquo; and the
committee (the Labour Representation Committee) was elected
for the purpose. Under their auspices 29 out of 51 candidates
were returned at the election of 1906. These groups were distinct
from the Labour members (&ldquo;Lib.-Labs&rdquo;) who obeyed the Liberal
whips and acted with the Liberals. In 1908 the attempts to
unite the parliamentary representatives of the Independent
Labour party with the Trades Union members were successful.
In June of that year the Miners&rsquo; Federation, returning 15
members, joined the Independent Labour party, now known
for parliamentary purposes as the &ldquo;Labour Party&rdquo;; other
Trades Unions, such as the Amalgamated Society of Railway
Servants, took the same step. This arrangement came into
force at the general election of 1910, when the bulk of the
miners&rsquo; representatives signed the constitution of the Labour
party, which after the election numbered 40 members of parliament.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABRADOR,<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span><a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> a great peninsula in British North America,
bounded E. by the North Atlantic, N. by Hudson Strait, W.
by Hudson and James Bays, and S. by an arbitrary line extending
eastwards from the south-east corner of Hudson Bay, near 51°
N., to the mouth of the Moisie river, on the Gulf of St Lawrence,
in 50° N., and thence eastwards by the Gulf of St Lawrence. It
extends from 50° to 63° N., and from 55° to 80° W., and embraces
an approximate area of 511,000 sq. m. Recent explorations
and surveys have added greatly to the knowledge of this vast
region, and have shown that much of the peninsula is not a
land of &ldquo;awful desolation,&rdquo; but a well-wooded country, containing
latent resources of value in its forests, fisheries and minerals.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Physical Geography.</i>&mdash;Labrador forms the eastern limb of the V
in the Archaean protaxis of North America (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Canada</a></span>), and includes
most of the highest parts of that area. Along some portions
of the coasts of Hudson and also of Ungava Bay there is a fringe of
lowland, but most of the interior is a plateau rising toward the south
and east. The highest portion extends east and west between 52°
and 54° N., where an immense granite area lies between the headwaters
of the larger rivers of the four principal drainage basins; the
lowest area is between Hudson Bay and Ungava Bay in the north-west,
where the general level is not more than 500 ft. above the sea.
The only mountains are the range along the Atlantic coast, extending
from the Strait of Belle Isle to Cape Chidley; in their southern half
they rarely exceed 1500 ft., but increase in the northern half to a
general elevation of upwards of 2000 ft., with numerous sharp peaks
between 3000 and 5000 ft., some say 7000 or 8000 ft. The coasts are
deeply indented by irregular bays and fringed with rocky islands,
especially along the high Atlantic coast, where long narrow fiords
penetrate inland. Hamilton Inlet, 250 m. north of the Strait of Belle
Isle, is the longest of these bays, with a length of 150 m. and a
breadth varying from 2 to 30 m. The surface of the outer portions
of the plateau is deeply seamed by valleys, cut into the crystalline
rocks by the natural erosion of rivers, depending for their length and
depth upon the volume of water flowing through them. The valley
of the Hamilton river is the greatest, forms a continuation of the
valley of the Inlet and extends 300 m. farther inland, while its
bottom lies from 500 to 1500 ft. below the surface of the plateau into
which it is cut. The depressions between the low ridges of the
interior are occupied by innumerable lakes, many of great size,
including Mistassini, Mishikamau, Clearwater, Kaniapiskau and
Seal, all from 50 to 100 m. long. The streams discharging these lakes,
before entering their valleys, flow on a level with the country and
occupy all depressions, so that they frequently spread out into lake-expansions
and are often divided into numerous channels by large
islands. The descent into the valleys is usually abrupt, being made
by heavy rapids and falls; the Hamilton, from the level interior, in
a course of 12 m. falls 760 ft. into the head of its valley, this descent
including a sheer drop of 315 ft. at the Grand Falls, which, taken
with the large volume of the river, makes it the greatest fall in North
America. The rivers of the northern and western watersheds drain
about two-thirds of the peninsula; the most important of the former
are the Koksoak, the largest river of Labrador (over 500 m. long), the
George, Whale and Payne rivers, all flowing into Ungava Bay. The
large rivers flowing westwards into Hudson Bay are the Povungnituk,
Kogaluk, Great Whale, Big, East Main and Rupert, varying
in length from 300 to 500 m. The rivers flowing south are exceedingly
rapid, the Moisie, Romaine, Natashkwan and St Augustine
being the most important; all are about 300 m. long. The Atlantic
coast range throws most of the drainage northwards into the Ungava
basin, and only small streams fall into the ocean, except the
Hamilton, North-west and Kenamou, which empty into the head of
Hamilton Inlet.</p>

<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The peninsula is formed largely of crystalline schists and
gneisses associated with granites and other igneous rocks, all of
archaean age; there are also large areas of non-fossiliferous, stratified
limestones, cherts, shales and iron ores, the unaltered equivalents
of part of the schists and gneisses. Narrow strips of Animikie
(Upper Huronian or perhaps Cambrian) rocks occur along the low-lying
southern and western shores, but there are nowhere else
indications of the peninsula having been below sea-level since an
exceedingly remote time. During the glacial period the country was
covered by a thick mantle of ice, which flowed out radially from a
central collecting-ground. Owing to the extremely long exposure to
denudation, to the subsequent removal of the greater part of the
decomposed rock by glaciers, and to the unequal weathering of the
component rocks, it is now a plateau, which ascends somewhat
abruptly within a few miles of the coast-line to heights of between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
500 and 2000 ft. The interior is undulating, and traversed by ridges
of low, rounded hills, seldom rising more than 500 ft. above the
surrounding general level.</p>

<p><i>Minerals.</i>&mdash;The mineral wealth is undeveloped. Thick beds of
excellent iron ore cover large areas in the interior and along the
shores of Hudson and Ungava Bays. Large areas of mineralized
Huronian rocks have also been discovered, similar to areas in other
parts of Canada, where they contain valuable deposits of gold, copper,
nickel and lead; good prospects of these metals have been found.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate ranges from cold temperate on the southern
coasts to arctic on Hudson Strait, and is generally so rigorous that it
is doubtful if the country is fit for agriculture north of 51°, except
on the low grounds near the coast. On James Bay good crops of
potatoes and other roots are grown at Fort George, 54° N., while
about the head of Hamilton Inlet, on the east coast, and in nearly the
same latitude, similar crops are easily cultivated. On the outer coasts
the climate is more rigorous, being affected by the floating ice borne
southwards on the Arctic current. In the interior at Mistassini,
50° 30&prime; N, a crop of potatoes is raised annually, but they rarely
mature. No attempts at agriculture have been made elsewhere
inland. Owing to the absence of grass plains, there is little likelihood
that it will ever be a grazing district. There are only two
seasons in the interior: winter begins early in October, with the
freezing of the small lakes, and lasts until the middle of June, when
the ice on rivers and lakes melts and summer suddenly bursts forth.
From unconnected observations the lowest temperatures of the
interior range from &minus;50° F. to &minus;60° F., and are slightly higher along
the coast. The mean summer temperature of the interior is about
55° F., with frosts during every month in the northern portion.
On the Atlantic coast and in Hudson Bay the larger bays freeze solid
between the 1st and 15th of December, and these coasts remain ice-bound
until late in June. Hudson Strait is usually sufficiently open
for navigation about the 10th of July.</p>

<p><i>Vegetation.</i>&mdash;The southern half is included in the sub-Arctic forest
belt, and nine species of trees constitute the whole arborescent flora
of this region; these species are the white birch, poplar, aspen, cedar.
Banksian pine, white and black spruce, balsam fir and larch. The
forest is continuous over the southern portion to 53° N., the only
exceptions being the summits of rocky hills and the outer islands of
the Atlantic and Hudson Bay, while the low margins and river
valleys contain much valuable timber. To the northward the size
and number of barren areas rapidly increase, so that in 55° N. more
than half the country is treeless, and two degrees farther north the
limit of trees is reached, leaving, to the northward, only barrens
covered with low Arctic flowering plants, sedges and lichens.</p>

<p><i>Fisheries.</i>&mdash;The fisheries along the shores of the Gulf of St Lawrence
and of the Atlantic form practically the only industry of the white
population scattered along the coasts, as well as of a large proportion
of the inhabitants of Newfoundland. The census (1891) of Newfoundland
gave 10,478 men, 2081 women and 828 children employed
in the Labrador fishery in 861 vessels, of which the tonnage amounted
to 33,689; the total catch being 488,788 quintals of cod, 1275 tierces
of salmon and 3828 barrels of herring, which, compared with the
customs returns for 1880, showed an increase of cod and decreases of
salmon and herring. The salmon fishery along the Atlantic coast is
now very small, the decrease being probably due to excessive use of
cod-traps. The cod fishery is now carried on along the entire
Atlantic coast and into the eastern part of Ungava Bay, where
excellent catches have been made since 1893. The annual value of
the fisheries on the Canadian portion of the coast is about $350,000.
The fisheries of Hudson Bay and of the interior are wholly undeveloped,
though both the bay and the large lakes of the interior are
well stocked with several species of excellent fish, including Arctic
trout, brook trout, lake trout, white fish, sturgeon and cod.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population is approximately 14,500, or
about one person to every 35 sq. m.; it is made up of 3500 Indians,
2000 Eskimo and 9000 whites. The last are confined to the
coasts and to the Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s trading posts of the
interior. On the Atlantic coast they are largely immigrants
from Newfoundland, together with descendants of English
fishermen and Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s servants. To the north
of Hamilton Inlet they are of more or less mixed blood from
marriage with Eskimo women. The Newfoundland census of
1901 gave 3634 as the number of permanent white residents
along the Atlantic coast, and the Canadian census (1891) gave
a white population of 5728, mostly French Canadians, scattered
along the north shore of the Gulf of St Lawrence, while the
whites living at the inland posts did not exceed fifty persons.
It is difficult to give more than a rough approximation of the
number of the native population, owing to their habits of roving
from one trading post to another, and the consequent liability
of counting the same family several times if the returns are
computed from the books of the various posts, the only available
data for an enumeration. The following estimate is arrived
at in this manner: Indians&mdash;west coast, 1200; Ungava Bay,
200; east coast, 200; south coast, 1900. Eskimo&mdash;Atlantic
coast, 1000; south shore of Hudson Strait, 800; east coast
of Hudson Bay, 500. The Indians roam over the southern
interior in small bands, their northern limit being determined
by that of the trees on which they depend for fuel. They live
wholly by the chase, and their numbers are dependent upon
the deer and other animals; as a consequence there is a constant
struggle between the Indian and the lower animals for existence,
with great slaughter of the latter, followed by periodic
famines among the natives, which greatly reduce their numbers
and maintain an equilibrium. The native population has thus
remained about stationary for the last two centuries. The
Indians belong to the Algonquin family, and speak dialects of
the Cree language. By contact with missionaries and fur-traders
they are more or less civilized, and the great majority of them
are Christians. Those living north of the St Lawrence are
Roman Catholic, while the Indians of the western watershed
have been converted by the missionaries of the Church Mission
Society; the eastern and northern bands have not yet been
reached by the missionaries, and are still pagans. The Eskimo
of the Atlantic coast have long been under the guidance of the
Moravian missionaries, and are well advanced in civilization;
those of Hudson Bay have been taught by the Church Mission
Society, and promise well; while the Eskimo of Hudson Strait
alone remain without teachers, and are pagans. The Eskimo
live along the coasts, only going inland for short periods to hunt
the barren-ground caribou for their winter clothing; the rest
of the year they remain on the shore or the ice, hunting seals
and porpoises, which afford them food, clothing and fuel.
The christianized Indians and Eskimo read and write in their
own language; those under the teaching of the Church Mission
Society use a syllabic character, the others make use of the
ordinary alphabet.</p>

<p><i>Political Review.</i>&mdash;The peninsula is divided politically between
the governments of Canada, Newfoundland and the province
of Quebec. The government of Newfoundland, under Letters
Patent of the 28th of March 1876, exercises jurisdiction along
the Atlantic coast; the boundary between its territory and
that of Canada is a line running due north and south from Anse
Sablon, on the north shore of the Strait of Belle Isle, to 52° N.,
the remainder of the boundary being as yet undetermined. The
northern boundary of the province of Quebec follows the East
Main river to its source in Patamisk lake, thence by a line due
east to the Ashuanipi branch of the Hamilton river; it then
follows that river and Hamilton Inlet to the coast area under
the jurisdiction of Newfoundland. The remainder of the
peninsula, north of the province of Quebec, by order in council
dated the 18th of December 1897, was constituted Ungava
District, an unorganized territory under the jurisdiction of the
government of the Dominion of Canada.</p>

about 1770, and specimens were soon afterwards sent to the
secretary in London, the Rev. B. Latrobe. The felspar itself
is generally of a dull grey colour, with a rather greasy lustre,
but many specimens exhibit in certain directions a magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
play of colours&mdash;blue, green, orange, purple or red; the colour
in some specimens changing when the stone is viewed in different
directions. This optical effect, known sometimes as &ldquo;labradorescence,&rdquo;
seems due in some cases to the presence of minute
laminae of certain minerals, like göthite or haematite, arranged
parallel to the surface which reflects the colour; but in other
cases it may be caused not so much by inclusions as by a delicate
lamellar structure in the felspar. An aventurine effect is produced
by the presence of microscopic enclosures. The original
labradorite was found in the neighbourhood of Nain, notably
in a lagoon about 50 m. inland, and in St Paul&rsquo;s Island. Here
it occurs with hypersthene, of a rich bronzy sheen, forming a
coarse-grained norite. When wet, the stones are remarkably
brilliant, and have been called by the natives &ldquo;fire rocks.&rdquo;
Russia has also yielded chatoyant labradorite, especially near
Kiev and in Finland; a fine blue labradorite has been brought
from Queensland; and the mineral is also known in several
localities in the United States, as at Keeseville, in Essex county,
New York. The ornamental stone from south Norway, now
largely used as a decorative material in architecture, owes its
beauty to a felspar with a blue opalescence, often called labradorite,
but really a kind of orthoclase which Professor W. C.
Brögger has termed cryptoperthite, whilst the rock in which
it occurs is an augite-syenite called by him laurvigite, from
its chief locality, Laurvik in Norway. Common labradorite,
without play of colour, is an important constituent of such
rocks as gabbro, diorite, andesite, dolerite and basalt. (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plagioclase</a></span>.) Ejected crystals of labradorite are found on
Monti Rossi, a double parasitic cone on Etna.</p>

<p>The term labradorite is unfortunately used also as a rock-name,
having been applied by Fouqué and Lévy to a group
of basic rocks rich in augite and poor in olivine.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA BRUYÈRE, JEAN DE<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> (1643-1696), French essayist and
moralist, was born in Paris on the 16th of August 1645, and not
as was once the common statement, at Dourdan (Seine-et-Oise)
in 1639. His family was of the middle class, and his reference
to a certain Geoffroy de la Bruyère, a crusader, is only a satirical
illustration of a method of self-ennoblement common in France
as in some other countries. Indeed he himself always signed the
name Delabruyère in one word, thus avowing his <i>roture</i>. His
progenitors, however, were of respectable position, and he could
trace them back at least as far as his great-grandfather, who had
been a strong Leaguer. La Bruyère&rsquo;s own father was controller-general
of finance to the Hôtel de Ville. The son was educated
by the Oratorians and at the university of Orleans; he was
called to the bar, and in 1673 bought a post in the revenue
department at Caen, which gave the status of noblesse and a
certain income. In 1687 he sold this office. His predecessor in it
was a relation of Bossuet, and it is thought that the transaction
was the cause of La Bruyère&rsquo;s introduction to the great orator.
Bossuet, who from the date of his own preceptorship of the
dauphin, was a kind of agent-general for tutorships in the royal
family, introduced him in 1684 to the household of the great
Condé, to whose grandson Henri Jules de Bourbon as well as
to that prince&rsquo;s girl-bride Mlle de Nantes, one of Louis XIV.&rsquo;s
natural children, La Bruyère became tutor. The rest of his life
was passed in the household of the prince or else at court, and
he seems to have profited by the inclination which all the Condé
family had for the society of men of letters. Very little is known
of the events of this part&mdash;or, indeed, of any part&mdash;of his life.
The impression derived from the few notices of him is of a silent,
observant, but somewhat awkward man, resembling in manners
Joseph Addison, whose master in literature La Bruyère undoubtedly
was. Yet despite the numerous enemies which his
book raised up for him, most of these notices are favourable&mdash;notably
that of Saint-Simon, an acute judge and one bitterly
prejudiced against <i>roturiers</i> generally. There is, however, a
curious passage in a letter from Boileau to Racine in which he
regrets that &ldquo;nature has not made La Bruyère as agreeable as
he would like to be.&rdquo; His <i>Caractères</i> appeared in 1688, and at
once, as Nicolas de Malezieu had predicted, brought him &ldquo;bien
des lecteurs et bien des ennemis.&rdquo; At the head of these were
Thomas Corneille, Fontenelle and Benserade, who were pretty
clearly aimed at in the book, as well as innumerable other
persons, men and women of letters as well as of society, on whom
the cap of La Bruyère&rsquo;s fancy-portraits was fitted by manuscript
&ldquo;keys&rdquo; compiled by the scribblers of the day. The friendship
of Bossuet and still more the protection of the Condés sufficiently
defended the author, and he continued to insert fresh portraits
of his contemporaries in each new edition of his book, especially
in the 4th (1689). Those, however, whom he had attacked were
powerful in the Academy, and numerous defeats awaited La
Bruyère before he could make his way into that guarded hold.
He was defeated thrice in 1691, and on one memorable occasion
he had but seven votes, five of which were those of Bossuet,
Boileau, Racine, Pellisson and Bussy-Rabutin. It was not
till 1693 that he was elected, and even then an epigram, which,
considering his admitted insignificance in conversation, was not
of the worst, <i>haesit lateri</i>:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Quand la Bruyère se présente</p>
    <p class="i2">Pourquoi faut il crier haro?</p>
<p>Pour faire un nombre de quarante</p>
    <p class="i2">Ne falloit il pas un zéro?&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>His unpopularity was, however, chiefly confined to the subjects
of his sarcastic portraiture, and to the hack writers of the time,
of whom he was wont to speak with a disdain only surpassed
by that of Pope. His description of the <i>Mercure galant</i> as
&ldquo;<i>immédiatement au dessous de rien</i>&rdquo; is the best-remembered
specimen of these unwise attacks; and would of itself account
for the enmity of the editors, Fontenelle and the younger
Corneille. La Bruyère&rsquo;s discourse of admission at the Academy,
one of the best of its kind, was, like his admission itself, severely
criticized, especially by the partisans of the &ldquo;Moderns&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Ancient and Modern&rdquo; quarrel. With the <i>Caractères</i>, the
translation of Theophrastus, and a few letters, most of them
addressed to the prince de Condé, it completes the list of his
literary work, with the exception of a curious and much-disputed
posthumous treatise. La Bruyère died very suddenly, and not
long after his admission to the Academy. He is said to have been
struck with dumbness in an assembly of his friends, and, being
carried home to the Hôtel de Condé, to have expired of apoplexy
a day or two afterwards, on the 10th of May 1696. It is not
surprising that, considering the recent panic about poisoning,
the bitter personal enmities which he had excited and the peculiar
circumstances of his death, suspicions of foul play should have
been entertained, but there was apparently no foundation for
them. Two years after his death appeared certain <i>Dialogues sur
le Quiétisme</i>, alleged to have been found among his papers incomplete,
and to have been completed by the editor. As these
dialogues are far inferior in literary merit to La Bruyère&rsquo;s other
works, their genuineness has been denied. But the straightforward
and circumstantial account of their appearance given
by this editor, the Abbé du Pin, a man of acknowledged probity,
the intimacy of La Bruyère with Bossuet, whose views in his
contest with Fénelon these dialogues are designed to further,
and the entire absence, at so short a time after the alleged author&rsquo;s
death, of the least protest on the part of his friends and representatives,
seem to be decisive in their favour.</p>

<p>Although it is permissible to doubt whether the value of the
<i>Caractères</i> has not been somewhat exaggerated by traditional
French criticism, they deserve beyond all question a high place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
The plan of the book is thoroughly original, if that term may be
accorded to a novel and skilful combination of existing elements.
The treatise of Theophrastus may have furnished the first idea,
but it gave little more. With the ethical generalizations and
social Dutch painting of his original La Bruyère combined the
peculiarities of the Montaigne essay, of the <i>Pensées</i> and <i>Maximes</i>
of which Pascal and La Rochefoucauld are the masters respectively,
and lastly of that peculiar 17th-century product, the
&ldquo;portrait&rdquo; or elaborate literary picture of the personal and
mental characteristics of an individual. The result was quite
unlike anything that had been before seen, and it has not been
exactly reproduced since, though the essay of Addison and Steele
resembles it very closely, especially in the introduction of fancy
portraits. In the titles of his work, and in its extreme desultoriness,
La Bruyère reminds the reader of Montaigne, but he aimed
too much at sententiousness to attempt even the apparent continuity
of the great essayist. The short paragraphs of which his
chapters consist are made up of maxims proper, of criticisms
literary and ethical, and above all of the celebrated sketches of
individuals baptized with names taken from the plays and
romances of the time. These last are the great feature of the
work, and that which gave it its immediate if not its enduring
popularity. They are wonderfully piquant, extraordinarily
life-like in a certain sense, and must have given great pleasure
or more frequently exquisite pain to the originals, who were in
many cases unmistakable and in most recognizable.</p>

<p>But there is something wanting in them. The criticism of
Charpentier, who received La Bruyère at the Academy, and
who was of the opposite faction, is in fact fully justified as far
as it goes. La Bruyère literally &ldquo;est [trop] descendu dans le
particulier.&rdquo; He has neither, like Molière, embodied abstract
peculiarities in a single life-like type, nor has he, like Shakespeare,
made the individual pass <i>sub speciem aeternitatis</i>, and serve as
a type while retaining his individuality. He is a photographer
rather than an artist in his portraiture. So, too, his maxims,
admirably as they are expressed, and exact as their truth often
is, are on a lower level than those of La Rochefoucauld. Beside
the sculpturesque precision, the Roman brevity, the profoundness
of ethical intuition &ldquo;piercing to the accepted hells beneath,&rdquo;
of the great Frondeur, La Bruyère has the air of a literary
<i>petit-maître</i> dressing up superficial observation in the finery
of <i>esprit</i>. It is indeed only by comparison that he loses, but then
it is by comparison that he is usually praised. His abundant
wit and his personal &ldquo;malice&rdquo; have done much to give him his
rank in French literature, but much must also be allowed to
his purely literary merits. With Racine and Massillon he is
probably the very best writer of what is somewhat arbitrarily
styled classical French. He is hardly ever incorrect&mdash;the highest
merit in the eyes of a French academic critic. He is always
well-bred, never obscure, rarely though sometimes &ldquo;precious&rdquo;
in the turns and niceties of language in which he delights to
indulge, in his avowed design of attracting readers by form,
now that, in point of matter, &ldquo;tout est dit.&rdquo; It ought to be
added to his credit that he was sensible of the folly of impoverishing
French by ejecting old words. His chapter on &ldquo;Les ouvrages
de l&rsquo;esprit&rdquo; contains much good criticism, though it shows that,
like most of his contemporaries except Fénelon, he was lamentably
ignorant of the literature of his own tongue.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The editions of La Bruyère, both partial and complete, have been
extremely numerous. <i>Les Caractères de Théophraste traduits du
Grec, avec les caractères et les m&oelig;urs de ce siècle</i>, appeared for the
first time in 1688, being published by Michallet, to whose little
daughter, according to tradition, La Bruyère gave the profits of the
book as a dowry. Two other editions, little altered, were published
in the same year. In the following year, and in each year until 1694,
with the exception of 1693, a fresh edition appeared, and, in all these
five, additions, omissions and alterations were largely made. A
ninth edition, not much altered, was put forth in the year of the
author&rsquo;s death. The Academy speech appeared in the eighth edition.
The Quietist dialogues were published in 1699; most of the letters,
including those addressed to Condé, not till 1867. In recent times
numerous editions of the complete works have appeared, notably
those of Walckenaer (1845), Servois (1867, in the series of <i>Grands
écrivains de la France</i>), Asselineau (a scholarly reprint of the last
original edition, 1872) and finally Chassang (1876); the last is one
of the most generally useful, as the editor has collected almost everything
of value in his predecessors. The literature of &ldquo;keys&rdquo; to
La Bruyère is extensive and apocryphal. Almost everything that
can be done in this direction and in that of general illustration was
done by Edouard Fournier in his learned and amusing <i>Comédie de
La Bruyère</i> (1866); M. Paul Morillot contributed a monograph on
La Bruyère to the series of <i>Grands écrivains français</i> in 1904.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABUAN<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (a corruption of the Malay word <i>labuh-an</i>, signifying
an &ldquo;anchorage&rdquo;), an island of the Malay Archipelago, off the
north-west coast of Borneo in 5° 16&prime; N., 115° 15&prime; E. Its area
is 30.23 sq. m.; it is distant about 6 m. from the mainland
of Borneo at the nearest point, and lies opposite to the northern
end of the great Brunei Bay. The island is covered with low
hills rising from flats near the shore to an irregular plateau
near the centre. About 1500 acres are under rice cultivation,
and there are scattered patches of coco-nut and sago palms and
a few vegetable gardens, the latter owned for the most part
by Chinese. For the rest Labuan is covered over most of its
extent by vigorous secondary growth, amidst which the charred
trunks of trees rise at frequent intervals, the greater part of the
forest of the island having been destroyed by great accidental
conflagrations. Labuan was ceded to Great Britain in 1846,
chiefly through the instrumentality of Sir James Brooke, the
first raja of Sarawak, and was occupied two years later.</p>

<p>At the time of its cession the island was uninhabited, but in
1881 the population numbered 5731, though it had declined to
5361 in 1891. The census returns for 1901 give the population
at 8411. The native population consists of Malay fishermen,
Chinese, Tamils and small shifting communities of Kadayans,
Tutongs and other natives of the neighbouring Bornean coast.
There are about fifty European residents. At the time of its
occupation by Great Britain a brilliant future was predicted
for Labuan, which it was thought would become a second
Singapore. These hopes have not been realized. The coal
deposits, which are of somewhat indifferent quality, have been
worked with varying degrees of failure by a succession of companies,
one of which, the Labuan &amp; Borneo Ltd., liquidated in
1902 after the collapse of a shaft upon which large sums had
been expended. It was succeeded by the Labuan Coalfields
Ltd. The harbour is a fine one, and the above-named company
possesses three wharves capable of berthing the largest Eastern-going
ocean steamers. To-day Labuan chiefly exists as a trading
depôt for the natives of the neighbouring coast of Borneo, who
sell their produce&mdash;beeswax, edible birds-nests, camphor,
gutta, trepang, &amp;c.,&mdash;to Chinese shopkeepers, who resell it in
Singapore. There is also a considerable trade in sago, much of
which is produced on the mainland, and there are three small
sago-factories on the island where the raw product is converted
into flour. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has a
central station at Labuan with cables to Singapore, Hong-Kong
and British North Borneo. Monthly steam communication
is maintained by a German firm between Labuan, Singapore
and the Philippines. The colony joined the Imperial Penny
Postage Union in 1889. There are a few miles of road on the
island and a metre-gauge railway from the harbour to the coal
mines, the property of the company. There is a Roman Catholic
church with a resident priest, an Anglican church, visited periodically
by a clergyman from the mainland, two native and Chinese
schools, and a sailors&rsquo; club, built by the Roman Catholic mission.
The bishop of Singapore and Sarawak is also bishop of Labuan.
The European graveyard has repeatedly been the scene of
outrages perpetrated, it is believed, by natives from the mainland
of Borneo, the graves being rifled and the hair of the head and
other parts of the corpses being carried off to furnish ornaments
to weapons and ingredients in the magic philtres of the natives.
Pulau Dat, a small island in the near neighbourhood of Labuan,
is the site of a fine coco-nut plantation whence nuts and copra
are exported in bulk. The climate is hot and very humid.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Until 1869 the expenditure of the colony was partly defrayed by
imperial grants-in-aid, but after that date it was left to its own
resources. A garrison of imperial troops was maintained until 1871,
when the troops were withdrawn after many deaths from fever and
dysentery had occurred among them. Since then law and order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
have been maintained without difficulty by a small mixed police
force of Punjabis and Malays. From the 1st of January 1890 to the
1st of January 1906 Labuan was transferred for administrative
purposes to the British North Borneo Company, the governor for the
time being of the company&rsquo;s territories holding also the royal commission
as governor of Labuan. This arrangement did not work
satisfactorily and called forth frequent petitions and protests from
the colonists. Labuan was then placed under the government of
the Straits Settlements, and is administered by a deputy governor
who is a member of the Straits Civil Service.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABURNUM,<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> known botanically as <i>Laburnum vulgare</i> (or
<i>Cytisus Laburnum</i>), a familiar tree of the pea family (Leguminosae);
it is also known as &ldquo;golden chain&rdquo; and &ldquo;golden rain.&rdquo;
It is a native of the mountains of France, Switzerland, southern
Germany, northern Italy, &amp;c., has long been cultivated as an
ornamental tree throughout Europe, and was introduced into
north-east America by the European colonists. Gerard records
it as growing in his garden in 1597 under the names of anagyris,
laburnum or beane trefoyle (<i>Herball</i>, p. 1239), but the date of
its introduction into England appears to be unknown. In
France it is called <i>l&rsquo;aubour</i>&mdash;a corruption from laburnum
according to Du Hamel&mdash;as also <i>arbois</i>, <i>i.e.</i> <i>arc-bois</i>, &ldquo;the
wood having been used by the ancient Gauls for bows. It
is still so employed in some parts of the Mâconnois, where the
bows are found to preserve their strength and elasticity for half
a century&rdquo; (Loudon, <i>Arboretum</i>, ii. 590).</p>

<p>Several varieties of this tree are cultivated, differing in the
size of the flowers, in the form of the foliage, &amp;c., such as the
&ldquo;oak-leafed&rdquo; (<i>quercifolium</i>), <i>pendulum</i>, <i>crispum</i>, &amp;c.; var.
<i>aureum</i> has golden yellow leaves. One of the most remarkable
forms is <i>Cytisus Adami</i> (<i>C. purpurascens</i>), which bears three
kinds of blossoms, viz. racemes of pure yellow flowers, others
of a purple colour and others of an intermediate brick-red tint.
The last are hybrid blossoms, and are sterile, with malformed
ovules, though the pollen appears to be good. The yellow
and purple &ldquo;reversions&rdquo; are fertile. It originated in Paris
in 1828 by M. Adam, who inserted a &ldquo;shield&rdquo; of the bark of
Cytisus purpureus into a stock of Laburnum. A vigorous shoot
from this bud was subsequently propagated. Hence it would
appear that the two distinct species became united by their
cambium layers, and the trees propagated therefrom subsequently
reverted to their respective parentages in bearing both yellow
and purple flowers, but produce as well blossoms of an intermediate
or hybrid character. Such a result may be called a
&ldquo;graft-hybrid.&rdquo; For full details see Darwin&rsquo;s <i>Animals and
Plants under Domestication</i>.</p>

<p>The laburnum has highly poisonous properties. The roots
taste like liquorice, which is a member of the same family as
the laburnum. It has proved fatal to cattle, though hares and
rabbits eat the bark of it with avidity (<i>Gardener&rsquo;s Chronicle</i>,
1881, vol. xvi. p. 666). The seeds also are highly poisonous,
possessing emetic as well as acrid narcotic principles, especially
in a green state. Gerard (<i>loc. cit.</i>) alludes to the powerful effect
produced on the system by taking the bruised leaves medicinally.
Pliny states that bees will not visit the flowers (<i>N.H.</i> xvi. 31),
but this is an error, as bees and butterflies play an important
part in the fertilization of the flowers, which they visit for the
nectar.</p>

<p>The heart wood of the laburnum is of a dark reddish-brown
colour, hard and durable, and takes a good polish. Hence it
is much prized by turners, and used with other coloured woods
for inlaying purposes. The laburnum has been called false
ebony from this character of its wood.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LABYRINTH<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="labyrinthos">&#955;&#945;&#946;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>, Lat. <i>labyrinthus</i>), the name
given by the Greeks and Romans to buildings, entirely or partly
subterranean, containing a number of chambers and intricate
passages, which rendered egress puzzling and difficult. The word
is considered by some to be of Egyptian origin, while others
connect it with the Gr. <span class="grk" title="laura">&#955;&#945;&#8166;&#961;&#945;</span>, the passage of a mine. Another
derivation suggested is from <span class="grk" title="labrys">&#955;&#940;&#946;&#961;&#965;&#962;</span>, a Lydian or Carian word
meaning a &ldquo;double-edged axe&rdquo; (<i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i>,
xxi. 109, 268), according to which the Cretan labyrinth or
palace of Minos was the house of the double axe, the symbol
of Zeus.</p>

<p>Pliny (<i>Nat. Hist.</i> xxxvi. 19, 91) mentions the following as the
four famous labyrinths of antiquity.</p>

<p>1. The Egyptian: of which a description is given by Herodotus
(ii. 148) and Strabo (xvii. 811). It was situated to the east of
Lake Moeris, opposite the ancient site of Arsinoë or Crocodilopolis.
According to Egyptologists, the word means &ldquo;the temple
at the entrance of the lake.&rdquo; According to Herodotus, the
entire building, surrounded by a single wall, contained twelve
courts and 3000 chambers, 1500 above and 1500 below ground.
The roofs were wholly of stone, and the walls covered with
sculpture. On one side stood a pyramid 40 orgyiae, or about
243 ft. high. Herodotus himself went through the upper
chambers, but was not permitted to visit those underground,
which he was told contained the tombs of the kings who had
built the labyrinth, and of the sacred crocodiles. Other ancient
authorities considered that it was built as a place of meeting for
the Egyptian nomes or political divisions; but it is more likely
that it was intended for sepulchral purposes. It was the work
of Amenemh&#275; III., of the 12th dynasty, who lived about 2300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
It was first located by the Egyptologist Lepsius to the north of
Hawara in the Fayum, and (in 1888) Flinders Petrie discovered
its foundation, the extent of which is about 1000 ft. long by
800 ft. wide. Immediately to the north of it is the pyramid of
Hawara, in which the mummies of the king and his daughter
have been found (see W. M. Flinders Petrie, <i>Hawara, Biahmu,
and Arsinoë</i>, 1889).</p>

<p>2. The Cretan: said to have been built by Daedalus on the
plan of the Egyptian, and famous for its connexion with the
legend of the Minotaur. It is doubtful whether it ever had any
real existence and Diodorus Siculus says that in his time it had
already disappeared. By the older writers it was placed near
Cnossus, and is represented on coins of that city, but nothing
corresponding to it has been found during the course of the recent
excavations, unless the royal palace was meant. The rocks of
Crete are full of winding caves, which gave the first idea of the
legendary labyrinth. Later writers (for instance, Claudian,
<i>De sexto Cons. Honorii</i>, 634) place it near Gortyna, and a set
of winding passages and chambers close to that place is still
pointed out as the labyrinth; these are, however, in reality
ancient quarries.</p>

<p>3. The Lemnian: similar in construction to the Egyptian.
Remains of it existed in the time of Pliny. Its chief feature

the tomb of Porsena at Clusium. This tomb was 300 ft. square
and 50 ft. high, and underneath it was a labyrinth, from which
it was exceedingly difficult to find an exit without the assistance
of a clew of thread. It has been maintained that this tomb is to

<p>In gardening, a labyrinth or <i>maze</i> means an intricate network
of pathways enclosed by hedges or plantations, so that those
who enter become bewildered in their efforts to find the centre or
make their exit. It is a remnant of the old geometrical style of
gardening. There are two methods of forming it. That which
is perhaps the more common consists of walks, or alleys as they
were formerly called, laid out and kept to an equal width or
nearly so by parallel hedges, which should be so close and thick
that the eye cannot readily penetrate them. The task is to get
to the centre, which is often raised, and generally contains a
covered seat, a fountain, a statue or even a small group of trees.
After reaching this point the next thing is to return to the
entrance, when it is found that egress is as difficult as ingress.
To every design of this sort there should be a key, but even those
who know the key are apt to be perplexed. Sometimes the
design consists of alleys only, as in fig. 1, published in 1706 by
London and Wise. In such a case, when the farther end is
reached, there only remains to travel back again. Of a more
pretentious character was a design published by Switzer in 1742.
This is of octagonal form, with very numerous parallel hedges and
paths, and &ldquo;six different entrances, whereof there is but one
that leads to the centre, and that is attended with some difficulties
and a great many stops.&rdquo; Some of the older designs for labyrinths,
however, avoid this close parallelism of the alleys, which,
though equally involved and intricate in their windings, are
carried through blocks of thick planting, as shown in fig. 2, from
a design published in 1728 by Batty Langley. These blocks of
shrubbery have been called wildernesses. To this latter class
belongs the celebrated labyrinth at Versailles (fig. 3), of which
Switzer observes, that it &ldquo;is allowed by all to be the noblest of
its kind in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Whatever style be adopted, it is essential that there should be a
thick healthy growth of the hedges or shrubberies that confine the
wanderer. The trees used should be impenetrable to the eye, and
so tall that no one can look over them; and the paths should be of
gravel and well kept. The trees chiefly used for the hedges, and
the best for the purpose, are the hornbeam among deciduous trees,
or the yew among evergreens. The beech might be used instead of
the hornbeam on suitable soil. The green holly might be planted
as an evergreen with very good results, and so might the American
arbor vitae if the natural soil presented no obstacle. The ground
must be well prepared, so as to give the trees a good start, and a
mulching of manure during the early years of their growth would
be of much advantage. They must be kept trimmed in or clipped,
especially in their earlier stages; trimming with the knife is much to
be preferred to clipping with shears. Any plants getting much in
advance of the rest should be topped, and the whole kept to some
4 ft. or 5 ft. in height until the lower parts are well thickened, when
it may be allowed to acquire the allotted height by moderate annual
increments. In cutting, the hedge (as indeed all hedges) should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
kept broadest at the base and narrowed upwards, which prevents it
from getting thin and bare below by the stronger growth being drawn
to the tops.</p>

<p>The maze in the gardens at Hampton Court Palace (fig. 4) is considered
one of the finest examples in England. It was planted in
the early part of the reign of William III., though it has been supposed
that a maze had existed there since the time of Henry VIII.
It is constructed on the hedge and alley system, and was, it is
believed, originally planted with hornbeam, but many of the plants
have been replaced by hollies, yews, &amp;c., so that the vegetation
is mixed. The walks are about half a mile in length, and the ground
occupied is a little over a quarter of an acre. The centre contains
two large trees, with a seat beneath each. The key to reach this
resting place is to keep the right hand continuously in contact with
the hedge from first to last, going round all the stops.</p>

<p>The maze in the gardens at Somerleyton Hall, near Lowestoft (fig.
5), was designed by Mr John Thomas. The hedges are of English
yew, are about 6½ ft. high, and have been planted about sixty years.
In the centre is a grass mound, raised to the height of the hedges, and
on this mound is a pagoda, approached by a curved grass path. At
the two corners on the western side are banks of laurels 15 or 16 ft.
high. On each side of the hedges throughout the labyrinth is a
small strip of grass.</p>

<p>There was also a labyrinth at Theobald&rsquo;s Park, near Cheshunt,
when this place passed from the earl of Salisbury into the possession
of James I. Another is said to have existed at Wimbledon House,
the seat of Earl Spencer, which was probably laid out by Brown in
the 18th century. There is an interesting labyrinth, somewhat after
the plan of fig. 2, at Mistley Place, Manningtree.</p>

<p>When the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at South
Kensington were being planned, Albert, Prince Consort, the president
of the society, especially desired that there should be a maze formed
in the ante-garden, which was made in the form shown in fig. 6.
This labyrinth, designed by Lieut. W. A. Nesfield, was for many years
the chief point of attraction to the younger visitors to the gardens;
but it was allowed to go to ruin, and had to be destroyed. The gardens
themselves are now built over.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAC,<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> a resinous incrustation formed on the twigs and young
branches of various trees by an insect, <i>Coccus lacca</i>, which infests
them. The term lac (<i>laksha</i>, Sanskrit; <i>lakh</i>, Hindi) is the same
as the numeral lakh&mdash;a hundred thousand&mdash;and is indicative
of the countless hosts of insects which make their appearance
with every successive generation. Lac is a product of the East
Indies, coming especially from Bengal, Pegu, Siam and Assam,
and is produced by a number of trees of the species <i>Ficus</i>,
particularly <i>F. religiosa</i>. The insect which yields it is closely
allied to the cochineal insect, <i>Coccus cacti</i>; kermes, <i>C. ilicis</i>
and Polish grains, <i>C. polonicus</i>, all of which, like the lac insect,
yield a red colouring matter. The minute larval insects fasten
in myriads on the young shoots, and, inserting their long proboscides
into the bark, draw their nutriment from the sap of the
plant. The insects begin at once to exude the resinous secretion
over their entire bodies; this forms in effect a cocoon, and, the
separate exudations coalescing, a continuous hard resinous
layer regularly honeycombed with small cavities is deposited
over and around the twig. From this living tomb the female
insects, which form the great bulk of the whole, never escape.
After their impregnation, which takes place on the liberation
of the males, about three months from their first appearance, the
females develop into a singular amorphous organism consisting
in its main features of a large smooth shining crimson-coloured
sac&mdash;the ovary&mdash;with a beak stuck into the bark, and a few
papillary processes projected above the resinous surface. The
red fluid in the ovary is the substance which forms the lac dye
of commerce. To obtain the largest amount of both resin and
dye-stuff it is necessary to gather the twigs with their living
inhabitants in or near June and November. Lac encrusting
the twigs as gathered is known in commerce as &ldquo;stick lac&rdquo;; the
resin crushed to small fragments and washed in hot water to
free it from colouring matter constitutes &ldquo;seed lac&rdquo;; and this,
when melted, strained through thick canvas, and spread out into
thin layers, is known as &ldquo;shellac,&rdquo; and is the form in which the
resin is usually brought to European markets. Shellac varies
in colour from a dark amber to an almost pure black; the palest,
known as &ldquo;orange-lac,&rdquo; is the most valuable; the darker varieties&mdash;&ldquo;liver-coloured,&rdquo;
&ldquo;ruby,&rdquo; &ldquo;garnet,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;diminish in
value as the colour deepens. Shellac may be bleached by dissolving
it in a boiling lye of caustic potash and passing chlorine
through the solution till all the resin is precipitated, the product
being known as white shellac. Bleached lac takes light delicate
shades of colour, and dyed a golden yellow it is much used in
the East Indies for working into chain ornaments for the head
and for other personal adornments. Lac is a principal ingredient
in sealing-wax, and forms the basis of some of the most valuable
varnishes, besides being useful in various cements, &amp;c. Average
stick lac contains about 68% of resin, 10 of lac dye and 6 of a
waxy substance. Lac dye is obtained by evaporating the water
in which stick lac is washed, and comes into commerce in the
form of small square cakes. It is in many respects similar to,
although not identical with, cochineal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACAILLE, NICOLAS LOUIS DE<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> (1713-1762), French astronomer,
was born at Rumigny, in the Ardennes, on the 15th of
March 1713. Left destitute by the death of his father, who held
a post in the household of the duchess of Vendôme, his theological
studies at the Collège de Lisieux in Paris were prosecuted at the
expense of the duke of Bourbon. After he had taken deacon&rsquo;s
orders, however, he devoted himself exclusively to science, and,
through the patronage of J. Cassini, obtained employment,
first in surveying the coast from Nantes to Bayonne, then, in
1739, in remeasuring the French arc of the meridian. The
success of this difficult operation, which occupied two years, and
achieved the correction of the anomalous result published by
J. Cassini in 1718, was mainly due to Lacaille&rsquo;s industry and
skill. He was rewarded by admission to the Academy and the
appointment of mathematical professor in Mazarin college,
where he worked in a small observatory fitted for his use. His
desire to observe the southern heavens led him to propose, in
1750, an astronomical expedition to the Cape of Good Hope,
which was officially sanctioned, and fortunately executed.
Among its results were determinations of the lunar and of the
solar parallax (Mars serving as an intermediary), the first
measurement of a South African arc of the meridian, and the
observation of 10,000 southern stars. On his return to Paris
in 1754 Lacaille was distressed to find himself an object of public
attention; he withdrew to Mazarin college, and there died,
on the 21st of March 1762, of an attack of gout aggravated by
unremitting toil. Lalande said of him that, during a comparatively
short life, he had made more observations and calculations
than all the astronomers of his time put together. The quality
of his work rivalled its quantity, while the disinterestedness
and rectitude of his moral character earned him universal
respect.</p>

politician and writer. Born at Manduria in southern Italy,
he practised law in Naples, and having come in contact with
a number of prominent Englishmen and Americans in that city,
he acquired a desire to study the English language. Although
a moderate Liberal in politics, he never joined any secret society,
but in 1851 after the restoration of Bourbon autocracy he was
arrested for having supplied Gladstone with information on
Bourbon misrule. Through the intervention of the British
and Russian ministers he was liberated, but on the publication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
of Gladstone&rsquo;s famous letters to Lord Aberdeen he was obliged
to leave Naples. He first settled in Edinburgh, where he married
Maria Carmichael, and then in London where he made numerous
friends in literary and political circles, and was professor of
Italian at Queen&rsquo;s College from 1853 to 1856. In the latter year
he accompanied Lord Minto to Italy, on which occasion he
first met Cavour. From 1857 to 1863 he was private secretary
(non-political) to Lord Lansdowne, and in 1858 he accompanied
Gladstone to the Ionian Islands as secretary, for which services
he was made a K.C.M.G. the following year. In 1860 Francis II.
of Naples had implored Napoleon III. to send a squadron to
prevent Garibaldi from crossing over from Sicily to Calabria;
the emperor expressed himself willing to do so provided Great
Britain co-operated, and Lord John Russell was at first inclined
to agree. At this juncture Cavour, having heard of the scheme,
entrusted Lacaita, at the suggestion of Sir James Hudson, the
British minister at Turin, with the task of inducing Russell to
refuse co-operation. Lacaita, who was an intimate friend both
of Russell and his wife, succeeded, with the help of the latter,
in winning over the British statesman just as he was about to
accept the Franco-Neapolitan proposal, which was in consequence
abandoned. He returned to Naples late in 1860 and the
following year was elected member of parliament for Bitonto,
although he had been naturalized a British subject in 1855.
He took little part in parliamentary politics, but in 1876 was
created senator. He was actively interested in a number of
English companies operating in Italy, and was made one of the
directors of the Italian Southern Railway Co. He had a wide
circle of friends in many European countries and in America,
including a number of the most famous men in politics and
literature. He died in 1895 at Posilipo near Naples.</p>

and Tunisian coral fisheries and has an extensive industry in
the curing of sardines; but the harbour is small and exposed
to the N.E. and W. winds. The old fortified town, now almost
abandoned, is built on a rocky peninsula about 400 yds. long,

<p>La Calle from the times of its earliest records in the 10th century
has been the residence of coral merchants. In the 16th century
exclusive privileges of fishing for coral were granted by the
dey of Algiers to the French, who first established themselves
on a bay to the westward of La Calle, naming their settlement
Bastion de France; many ruins still exist of this town. In 1677
they moved their headquarters to La Calle. The company&mdash;<i>Compagnie
d&rsquo;Afrique</i>&mdash;who owned the concession for the fishery
was suppressed in 1798 on the outbreak of war between France
and Algeria. In 1806 the British consul-general at Algiers
obtained the right to occupy Bona and La Calle for an annual
rent of £11,000; but though the money was paid for several
years no practical effect was given to the agreement. The
French regained possession in 1817, were expelled during the
wars of 1827, when La Calle was burnt, but returned and rebuilt
the place in 1836. The boats engaged in the fishery were mainly
Italian, but the imposition, during the last quarter of the 19th
century, of heavy taxes on all save French boats drove the foreign
vessels away. For some years the industry was abandoned,
but was restarted on a small scale in 1903.</p>

(<i>c.</i> 1610-1663), French novelist and dramatist, was born at the
Château of Tolgou, near Sarlat (Dordogne), in 1609 or 1610.
After studying at Toulouse, he came to Paris and entered the
regiment of the guards, becoming in 1650 gentleman-in-ordinary
of the royal household. He died in 1663 in consequence of a
kick from his horse. He was the author of several long heroic
romances ridiculed by Boileau. They are: <i>Cassandre</i> (10 vols.,
1642-1650); <i>Cléopatre</i> (1648); <i>Faramond</i> (1661); and <i>Les
Nouvelles, ou les Divertissements de la princesse Alcidiane</i> (1661)
published under his wife&rsquo;s name, but generally attributed to
him. His plays lack the spirit and force that occasionally redeem
the novels. The best is <i>Le Comte d&rsquo;Essex</i>, represented in 1638,
which supplied some ideas to Thomas Corneille for his tragedy
of the same name.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA CARLOTA,<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> a town of the province of Negros Occidental,
Philippine Islands, on the W. coast of the island and the left
bank of San Enrique river, about 18 m. S. of Bacolod, the
capital of the province. Pop. (1903), after the annexation of
San Enrique, 19,192. There are fifty-four villages or barrios
in the town; the largest had a population in 1903 of 3254 and
two others had each more than 1000 inhabitants. The Panayano

<p><span class="bold">LACCADIVE ISLANDS,<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> a group of coral reefs and islands in
the Indian Ocean, lying between 10° and 12° 20&prime; N. and 71°
40&prime; and 74° E. The name Laccadives (<i>laksha dwipa</i>, the &ldquo;hundred
thousand isles&rdquo;) is that given by the people of the Malabar
coast, and was probably meant to include the Maldives; they
are called by the natives simply <i>Divi</i>, &ldquo;islands,&rdquo; or <i>Amendivi</i>,
from the chief island. There are seventeen separate reefs,
&ldquo;round each of which the 100-fathom line is continuous&rdquo;
(J. S. Gardiner). There are, however, only thirteen islands, and
of these only eight are inhabited. They fall into two groups&mdash;the
northern, belonging to the collectorate of South Kanara,
and including the inhabited islands of Amini, Kardamat, Kiltan
and Chetlat; and the southern, belonging to the administrative
district of Malabar, and including the inhabited islands of Agatti,
Kavaratti, Androth and Kalpeni. Between the Laccadives
and the Maldives to the south lies the isolated Minikoi, which
physically belongs to neither group, though somewhat nearer
to the Maldives (<i>q.v.</i>). The principal submerged banks lie north
of the northern group of islands; they are Munyal, Coradive
and Sesostris, and are of greater extent than those on which
the islands lie. The general depth over these is from 23 to 28
fathoms, but Sesostris has shallower soundings &ldquo;indicating
patches growing up, and some traces of a rim&rdquo; (J. S. Gardiner).
The islands have in nearly all cases emerged from the eastern
and protected side of the reef, the western being completely
exposed to the S.W. monsoon. The islands are small, none
exceeding a mile in breadth, while the total area is only about
80 sq. m. They lie so low that they would be hardly discernible
but for the coco-nut groves with which they are thickly covered.
The soil is light coral sand, beneath which, a few feet down,
lies a stratum of coral stretching over the whole of the islands.
This coral, generally a foot to a foot and a half in thickness,
has been in the principal islands wholly excavated, whereby
the underlying damp sand is rendered available for cereals.
These excavations&mdash;a work of vast labour&mdash;were made at a
remote period, and according to the native tradition by giants.
In these spaces (<i>totam</i>, &ldquo;garden&rdquo;) coarse grain, pulse, bananas
and vegetables are cultivated; coco-nuts grow abundantly
everywhere. For rice the natives depend upon the mainland.</p>

<p><i>Population and Trade</i>.&mdash;The population in 1901 was 10,274.
The people are Moplas, <i>i.e.</i> of mixed Hindu and Arab descent,
and are Mahommedans. Their manners and customs are similar
to those of the coast Moplas; but they maintain their own
ancient caste distinctions. The language spoken is Malayalim,
but it is written in the Arabic character. Reading and writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
are common accomplishments among the men. The chief
industry is the manufacture of coir. The various processes
are entrusted to the women. The men employ themselves
with boatbuilding and in conveying the island produce to the
coast. The exports from the Laccadives are of the annual
value of about £17,000.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;No data exist for determining at what period the
Laccadives were first colonized. The earliest mention of them as
distinguished from the Maldives seems to be by Albírúní (<i>c.</i> 1030),
who divides the whole archipelago (Díbaját) into the <i>Dívah Kúzah</i>
or Cowrie Islands (the Maldives), and the <i>Divah Kanbar</i> or Coir
Islands (the Laccadives). (See <i>Journ. Asiat. Soc.</i>, September 1844,
p. 265). The islanders were converted to Islam by an Arab apostle
named Mumba Mulyaka, whose grave at Androth still imparts a
peculiar sanctity to that island. The kazee of Androth was in 1847
still a member of his family, and was said to be the twenty-second
who had held the office in direct line from the saint. This gives
colour to the tradition that the conversion took place about 1250.
It is also further corroborated by the story given by the Ibn Batuta
of the conversion of the Maldives, which occurred, as he heard, four
generations (say one hundred and twenty years) before his visit to
these islands in 1342. The Portuguese discovered the Laccadives in
May 1498, and built forts upon them, but about 1545 the natives
rose upon their oppressors. The islands subsequently became a
suzerainty of the raja of Cannanore, and after the peace of Seringapatam,
1792 the southern group was permitted to remain under the
management of the native chief at a yearly tribute. This was often
in arrear, and on this account these islands were sequestrated by the
British government in 1877.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACCOLITE<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="lakkos">&#955;&#940;&#954;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, cistern, <span class="grk" title="lithos">&#955;&#943;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>, stone), in geology,
the name given by Grove K. Gilbert to intrusive masses
of igneous rock possessing a cake-like form, which he first
described from the Henry Mountains of southern Utah. Their
characteristic is that they have spread out along the bedding
planes of the strata, but are not so broad and thin as the sheets
or intrusive sills which, consisting usually of basic rocks, have
spread over immense distances without attaining any great
thickness. Laccolites cover a comparatively small area and
have greater thickness. Typically they have a domed upper
surface while their base is flat. In the Henry Mountains they
are from 1 to 5 m. in diameter and range in thickness up to
about 5000 ft. The cause of their peculiar shape appears to
be the viscosity of the rock injected, which is usually of intermediate
character and comparatively rich in alkalis, belonging
to the trachytes and similar lithological types. These are
much less fluid than the basalts, and the latter in consequence
spread out much more readily along the bedding planes, forming
thin flat-topped sills. At each side the laccolites thin out rapidly
so that their upper surface slopes steeply to the margins. The
strata above them which have been uplifted and bent are often
cracked by extension, and as the igneous materials well into
the fissures a large number of dikes is produced. At the base
of the laccolite, on the other hand, the strata are flat and dikes
are rare, though there may be a conduit up which the magma
has flowed into the laccolite. The rocks around are often
much affected by contact alteration, and great masses of them
have sometimes sunk into the laccolite, where they may be
partly melted and absorbed.</p>

<p>Gilbert obtained evidence that these laccolites were filled
at depths of 7000 to 10,000 ft. and did not reach the surface,
giving rise to volcanoes. From the effects on the drainage of
the country it seemed probable that above the laccolites the
strata swelled up in flattish eminences. Often they occur side
by side in groups belonging to a single period, though all the
members of each group are not strictly of the same age. One
laccolite may be formed on the side of an earlier one, and compound
laccolites also occur. When exposed by erosion they
give rise to hills, and their appearance varies somewhat with the
stage of development.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the western part of South America laccolites agreeing in all
essential points with those described by Gilbert occur in considerable
numbers and present some diversity of types. Occasionally they are
asymmetrical, or have one steep or vertical side while the other is
gently inclined. In other cases they split into a number of sheets
spreading outwards through the rocks around. But the term
laccolite has also been adopted by geologists in Britain and elsewhere
to describe a variety of intrusive masses not strictly identical in
character with those of the Henry Mountains. Some of these rest
on a curved floor, like the gabbro masses of the Cuillin Hills in Skye;
others are injected along a flattish plane of unconformability where
one system of rocks rests on the upturned and eroded edges of an
older series. An example of the latter class is furnished by the felsite
mass of the Black Hill in the Pentlands, near Edinburgh, which has
followed the line between the Silurian and the Old Red Sandstone,
forcing the rocks upwards without spreading out laterally to any
great extent.</p>

<p>The term laccolite has also been applied to many granite intrusions,
such as those of Cornwall. We know from the evidence of mining
shafts which have been sunk in the country near the edge of these
granites that they slope downwards underground with an angle of
twenty to thirty degrees. They have been proved also to have been
injected along certain wall-marked horizons; so that although the
rocks of the country have been folded in a very complicated manner
the granite can often be shown to adhere closely to certain members
of the stratigraphical sequence for a considerable distance. Hence it
is clear that their upper surfaces are convex and gently arched, and it
is conjectured that the strata must extend below them, though at a
great depth, forming a floor. The definite proof of this has not been
attained for no borings have penetrated the granites and reached
sedimentary rocks beneath them. But often in mountainous
countries where there are deep valleys the bases of great granite
laccolites are exposed to view in the hill sides. These granite sills
have a considerable thickness in proportion to their length, raise the
rocks above them and fill them with dikes, and behave generally like
typical laccolites. In contradistinction to intrusions of this type with
a well-defined floor we may place the batholiths, bysmaliths, plutonic
plugs and stocks, which have vertical margins and apparently descend
to unknown depths. It has been conjectured that masses of this type
eat their way upwards by dissolving the rock above them and absorbing
it, or excavate a passage by breaking up the roof of the space
they occupy while the fragments detached sink downwards and are
lost in the ascending magma.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACE<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> (corresponding to Ital. <i>merletto</i>, <i>trina</i>; Genoese <i>pizzo</i>;
Ger. <i>spitzen</i>; Fr. <i>dentelle</i>; Dutch <i>kanten</i>; Span. <i>encaje</i>; the
English word owes something to the Fr. <i>lassis</i> or <i>lacis</i>, but both
are connected with the earlier Lat. <i>laqueus</i>; early French laces
were also called <i>passements</i> or insertions and <i>dents</i> or edgings),
the name applied to ornamental open work formed of threads of
flax, cotton, silk, gold or silver, and occasionally of mohair or
aloe fibre, looped or plaited or twisted together by hand, (1) with
a needle, when the work is distinctively known as &ldquo;needlepoint
lace&rdquo;; (2) with bobbins, pins and a pillow or cushion, when the
work is known as &ldquo;pillow lace&rdquo;; and (3) by steam-driven
machinery, when imitations of both needlepoint and pillow
laces are produced. Lace-making implies the production of
ornament and fabric concurrently. Without a pattern or design
the fabric of lace cannot be made.</p>

<p>The publication of patterns for needlepoint and pillow laces
dates from about the middle of the 16th century. Before that
period lace described such articles as cords and narrow braids of
plaited and twisted threads, used not only to fasten shoes,
sleeves and corsets together, but also in a decorative manner to
braid the hair, to wind round hats, and to be sewn as trimmings
upon costumes. In a Harleian MS. of the time of Henry VI.
and Edward IV., about 1471, directions are given for the making
of &ldquo;lace Bascon, lace indented, lace bordered, lace covert, a
brode lace, a round lace, a thynne lace, an open lace, lace for
hattys,&rdquo; &amp;c. The MS. opens with an illuminated capital letter,
in which is the figure of a woman making these articles. The
MS. supplies a clear description how threads in combinations of
twos, threes, fours, fives, to tens and fifteens, were to be twisted
and plaited together. Instead of the pillow, bobbins and pins
with which pillow lace soon afterwards was made, the hands were
used, each finger of a hand serving as a peg upon which was
placed a &ldquo;bowys&rdquo; or &ldquo;bow,&rdquo; or little ball of thread. Each
ball might be of different colour from the other. The writer of
the MS. says that the first finger next the thumb shall be called
A, the next B, and so on. According to the sort of cord or braid
to be made, so each of the four fingers, A, B, C, D might be called
into service. A &ldquo;thynne lace&rdquo; might be made with three
threads, and then only fingers A, B, C would be required. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
&ldquo;round&rdquo; lace, stouter than the &ldquo;thynne&rdquo; lace, might require
the service of four or more fingers. By occasionally dropping
the use of threads from certain fingers a sort of indented lace or
braid might be made. But when laces of more importance
were wanted, such as a broad lace for &ldquo;hattys,&rdquo; the fingers on
the hands of assistants were required. The smaller cords or
&ldquo;thynne laces,&rdquo; when fastened in simple or fantastic loops along
the edges of collars and cuffs, were called &ldquo;purls&rdquo; (see the small
edge to the collar worn by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, Pl. II. fig. 4).
In another direction from which some suggestion may be derived
as to the evolution of lace-making, notice should be taken of the
fact that at an early period the darning of varied ornamental
devices, stiff and geometric in treatment into hand-made network
of small square meshes (see squares of &ldquo;lacis,&rdquo; Pl. I. fig. 1)
became specialized in many European countries. This is held
by some writers to be &ldquo;opus filatorium,&rdquo; or &ldquo;opus araneum&rdquo;
(spider work). Examples of this &ldquo;opus filatorium,&rdquo; said to date
from the 13th century exist in public collections. The productions
of this darning in the early part of the 16th century came
to be known as &ldquo;punto a maglia quadra&rdquo; in Italy and as
&ldquo;lacis&rdquo; in France, and through a growing demand for household
and wearing linen, very much of the &ldquo;lacis&rdquo; was made in white
threads not only in Italy and France but also in Spain. In
appearance it is a filmy fabric. With white threads also were
the &ldquo;purlings&rdquo; above mentioned made, by means of leaden
bobbins or &ldquo;fuxii,&rdquo; and were called &ldquo;merletti a piombini&rdquo; (see
lower border, Pl. II. fig. 3). Cut and drawn thread linen work
(the latter known as &ldquo;tela tirata&rdquo; in Italy and as &ldquo;deshilado&rdquo;
in Spain) were other forms of embroidery as much in vogue as
the darning on net and the &ldquo;purling.&rdquo; The ornament of much
of this cut and drawn linen work (see collar of Catherine de&rsquo;
Medici, Pl. II. fig. 4), more restricted in scope than that of the
darning on net, was governed by the recurrence of open squares
formed by the withdrawal of the threads. Within these squares
and rectangles radiating devices usually were worked by means
of whipped and buttonhole stitches (Pl. fig. 5). The general
effect in the linen was a succession of insertions or borders of
plain or enriched reticulations, whence the name &ldquo;punto a
reticella&rdquo; given to this class of embroidery in Italy. Work of
similar style and especially that with whipped stitches was done
rather earlier in the Grecian islands, which derived it from Asia
Minor and Persia. The close connexion of the Venetian republic
with Greece and the eastern islands, as well as its commercial
relations with the East, sufficiently explains an early transplanting
of this kind of embroidery into Venice, as well as in southern
Spain. At Venice besides being called &ldquo;reticella,&rdquo; cut work was
also called &ldquo;punto tagliato.&rdquo; Once fairly established as home
industries such arts were quickly exploited with a beauty and
variety of pattern, complexity of stitch and delicacy of execution,
until insertions and edgings made independently of any
linen as a starting base (see first two borders, Pl. II. fig. 3) came
into being under the name of &ldquo;Punto in aria&rdquo; (Pl. II. fig. 7).
This was the first variety of Venetian and Italian needlepoint
lace in the middle of the 16th century,<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and its appearance then
almost coincides in date with that of the &ldquo;merletti a piombini,&rdquo;
which was the earliest Italian cushion or pillow lace (see lower
edging, Pl. II. fig. 3).</p>

<p>The many varieties of needlepoint and pillow laces will be
touched on under the heading allotted to each of these methods
of making lace. Here, however, the general circumstances of
their genesis may be briefly alluded to. The activity in cord
and braid-making and in the particular sorts of ornamental
needlework already mentioned clearly postulated such special
labour as was capable of being converted into lace-making.
And from the 16th century onwards the stimulus to the industry
in Europe was afforded by regular trade demand, coupled with
the exertions of those who encouraged their dependents or
protegés to give their spare time to remunerative home occupations.
Thus the origin and perpetuation of the industry have
come to be associated with the women folk of peasants and
fishermen in circumstances which present little dissimilarity
whether in regard to needle lace workers now making lace in
whitewashed cottages and cabins at Youghal and Kenmare in
the south of Ireland, or those who produced their &ldquo;punti in aria&rdquo;
during the 16th century about the lagoons of Venice, or Frenchwomen
who made the sumptuous &ldquo;Points de France&rdquo; at
Alençon and elsewhere in the 17th and 18th centuries; or pillow
lace workers to be seen at the present day at little seaside villages
tucked away in Devonshire dells, or those who were engaged
more than four hundred years ago in &ldquo;merletti a piombini&rdquo; in
Italian villages or on &ldquo;Dentelles au fuseau&rdquo; in Flemish lowlands.
The ornamental character, however, of these several
laces would be found to differ much; but methods, materials,
appliances and opportunities of work would in the main be alike.
As fashion in wearing laces extended, so workers came to be
drawn together into groups by employers who acted as channels
for general trade.<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Nuns in the past as in the present have also
devoted attention to the industry, often providing in the convent
precincts workrooms not only for peasant women to carry out
commissions in the service of the church or for the trade, but
also for the purpose of training children in the art. Elsewhere
lace schools have been founded by benefactors or organized by
some leading local lace-maker<a name="fa3d" id="fa3d" href="#ft3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a> as much for trading as for
education. In all this variety of circumstance, development
of finer work has depended upon the abilities of the workers being
exercised under sound direction, whether derived through their
own intuitions, or supplied by intelligent and tasteful employers.
Where any such direction has been absent the industry viewed
commercially has suffered, its productions being devoid of artistic
effect or adaptability to the changing tastes of demand.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the two widely distant regions of Europe
where pictorial art first flourished and attained high perfection,
north Italy and Flanders, were precisely the localities where
lace-making first became an industry of importance both from
an artistic and from a commercial point of view. Notwithstanding
more convincing evidence as to the earlier development of
pillow lace making in Italy the invention of pillow lace is often
credited to the Flemings; but there is no distinct trace of the
time or the locality. In a picture said to exist in the church of
St Gomar at Lierre, and sometimes attributed to Quentin
Matsys (1495), is introduced a girl apparently working at some
sort of lace with pillow, bobbins, &amp;c., which are somewhat
similar to the implements in use in more recent times.<a name="fa4d" id="fa4d" href="#ft4d"><span class="sp">4</span></a> From
the very infancy of Flemish art an active intercourse was maintained
between the Low Countries and the great centres of
Italian art; and it is therefore only what might be expected
that the wonderful examples of the art and handiwork of Venice
in lace-making should soon have come to be known to and
rivalled among the equally industrious, thriving and artistic
Flemings. At the end of the 16th century pattern-books were
issued in Flanders having the same general character as those
published for the guidance of the Venetian and other Italian
lace-makers.</p>

<p>France and England were not far behind Venice and Flanders
in making needle and pillow lace. Henry III. of France (1574-1589)
appointed a Venetian, Frederic Vinciolo, pattern maker
for varieties of linen needle works and laces to his court. Through
the influence of this fertile designer the seeds of a taste for lace
in France were principally sown. But the event which <i>par
excellence</i> would seem to have fostered the higher development
of the French art of lace-making was the aid officially given it
in the following century by Louis XIV., acting on the advice
of his minister Colbert. Intrigue and diplomacy were put into
action to secure the services of Venetian lace-workers; and by
an edict dated 1665 the lace-making centres at Alençon, Quesnoy,
Arras, Reims, Sedan, Château Thierry, Loudun and elsewhere
were selected for the operations of a company in aid of which
the state made a contribution of 36,000 francs; at the same
time the importation of Venetian, Flemish and other laces was
strictly forbidden.<a name="fa5d" id="fa5d" href="#ft5d"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The edict contained instructions that the
lace-makers should produce all sorts of thread work, such as those
done on a pillow or cushion and with the needle, in the style
of the laces made at Venice, Genoa, Ragusa and other places;
these French imitations were to be called &ldquo;points de France.&rdquo;
By 1671 the Italian ambassador at Paris writes, &ldquo;Gallantly
is the minister Colbert on his way to bring the &lsquo;lavori d&rsquo;aria&rsquo; to
perfection.&rdquo; Six years later an Italian, Domenigo Contarini,
alludes to the &ldquo;punto in aria,&rdquo; &ldquo;which the French can now
do to admiration.&rdquo; The styles of design which emanated from
the chief of the French lace centre, Alençon, were more fanciful
and less severe than the Venetian, and it is evident that the
Flemish lace-makers later on adopted many of these French
patterns for their own use. The provision of French designs
(fig. 24) which owes so much to the state patronage, contrasts
with the absence of corresponding provision in England and
was noticed early in the 18th century by Bishop Berkeley.
&ldquo;How,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;could France and Flanders have drawn
so much money from other countries for figured silk, lace and
tapestry, if they had not had their academies of design?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span></p>

<p>The humble endeavours of peasantry in England (which
could boast of no schools of design), Germany, Sweden, Russia
and Spain could not result in work of so high artistic pretension
as that of France and Flanders. In the 18th century good lace
was made in Devonshire, but it is only in recent years that to
some extent the hand lace-makers of England and Ireland have
become impressed with the necessity of well-considered designs
for their work. Pillow lace making under the name of &ldquo;bone
lace making&rdquo; was pursued in the 17th century in Buckinghamshire,
Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire, and in 1724 Defoe refers
to the manufacture of bone lace in which villagers were &ldquo;wonderfully
exercised and improved within these few years past.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bone&rdquo; lace dates from the 17th century in England and was
practically the counterpart of Flemish &ldquo;dentelles au fuseau,&rdquo;
and related also to the Italian &ldquo;merletti a piombini&rdquo; (see
Pl. fig. 10). In Germany, Barbara Uttmann, a native
of Nuremberg, instructed peasants of the Harz mountains to
twist and plait threads in 1561. She was assisted by certain
refugees from Flanders. A sort of &ldquo;purling&rdquo; or imitation of
the Italian &ldquo;merletti a piombini&rdquo; was the style of work produced
then.</p>

<p>Lace of comparatively simple design has been made for centuries
in villages of Andalusia as well as in Spanish conventual establishments.
The &ldquo;point d&rsquo;Espagne,&rdquo; however, appears to have
been a commercial name given by French manufacturers of a
class of lace made in France with gold or silver threads on the
pillow and greatly esteemed by Spaniards in the 17th century.
No lace pattern-books have been found to have been published
in Spain. The needle-made laces which came out of Spanish
monasteries in 1830, when these institutions were dissolved,
were mostly Venetian needle-made laces. The lace vestments
preserved at the cathedral at Granada hitherto presumed to be of
Spanish work are verified as being Flemish of the 17th century
(similar in style to Pl. fig. 14). The industry is not alluded
to in Spanish ordinances of the 15th, 16th or 17th centuries, but
traditions which throw its origin back to the Moors or Saracens
are still current in Seville and its neighbourhood, where a
twisted and knotted arrangement of fine cords is often worked<a name="fa6d" id="fa6d" href="#ft6d"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
under the name of &ldquo;Morisco&rdquo; fringe, elsewhere called macramé
lace. Black and white silk pillow laces, or &ldquo;blondes,&rdquo; date from
the 18th century. They were made in considerable quantity
in the neighbourhood of Chantilly, and imported for mantillas
by Spain, where corresponding silk lace making was started.
Although after the 18th century the making of silk laces more or
less ceased at Chantilly and the neighbourhood, the craft is now
carried on in Normandy&mdash;at Bayeux and Caen&mdash;as well as in
Auvergne, which is also noted for its simple &ldquo;torchon&rdquo; laces.
Silk pillow lace making is carried on in Spain, especially at
Barcelona. The patterns are almost entirely imitations from
18th-century French ones of a large and free floral character.
Lace-making is said to have been promoted in Russia through
the patronage of the court, after the visit of Peter the Great to
Paris in the early days of the 18th century. Peasants in the
districts of Vologda, Balakhua (Nijni-Novgorod), Bieleff (Tula)
and Mzensk (Orel) make pillow laces of simple patterns. Malta
is noted for producing a silk pillow lace of black or white, or red
threads, chiefly of patterns in which repetitions of circles,
wheels and radiations of shapes resembling grains of wheat
are the main features. This characteristic of design, appearing
in white linen thread laces of similar make which have been
identified as Genoese pillow laces of the early 17th century,
reappears in Spanish and Paraguayan work. Pillow lace in
imitation of Maltese, Buckinghamshire and Devonshire laces
is made to a small extent in Ceylon, in different parts of India
and in Japan. A successful effort has also been made to re-establish
the industry in the island of Burano near Venice, and
pillow and needlepoint lace of good design is made there.</p>

<p>At present the chief sources of hand-made lace are France,
Belgium, Ireland and England.</p>

<p>France is faithful to her traditions in maintaining a lively
and graceful taste in lace-making. Fashion of late years has
called for ampler and more boldly effective laces, readily produced
with both braids and cords and far less intricate needle or pillow
work than was required for the dainty and smaller laces of
earlier date.</p>

<p>In Belgium the social and economic conditions are, as they
have been in the past, more conducive and more favourable
than elsewhere to lace-making at a sufficiently remunerative
rate of wages. The production of hand-made laces in Belgium
was in 1900 greater than that of France. The principal modern
needle-made lace of Belgium is the &ldquo;Point de Gaze&rdquo;;
&ldquo;Duchesse&rdquo; and Bruges laces are the chief pillow-made laces;
whilst &ldquo;Point Appliqué&rdquo; and &ldquo;Plat Appliqué&rdquo; are frequently
the results not only of combining needle-made and pillow work,
but also of using them in conjunction with machine-made net.
Ireland is the best producer of that substantial looped-thread
work known as crochet (see figs. 25, 26, 27), which must be
regarded as a hand-made lace fabric although not classifiable
as a needlepoint or pillow lace. It is also quite distinct in character
from pseudo-laces, which are really embroideries with a
lace-like appearance, <i>e.g.</i> embroideries on net, cut and embroidered
cambrics and fine linen. For such as these Ireland maintains
a reputation in its admirable Limerick and Carrickmacross
laces, made not only in Limerick and Carrickmacross, but also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
in Kinsale, Newry, Crossmaglen and elsewhere. The demand
from France for Irish crochet is now far beyond the supply, a
condition which leads not only to the rapid repetition by Irish
workers of old patterns, but tends also to a gradual debasement
of both texture and ornament. Attempts have been made to
counteract this tendency,
with some
success, as the specimens
of Irish crochet
in figs. 25, 26 and 27
indicate.</p>

<p>An appreciable
amount of pillow-made
lace is annually
supplied from
Devonshire, Buckinghamshire,
Bedfordshire
and Northampton, but it is bought almost wholly for
home use. The English laces are made almost entirely in accordance
with the precedents of the 19th century&mdash;that is to say, in
definite lengths and widths, as for borders, insertions and flounces,
although large shaped articles, such as panels for dresses, long
sleeves complete skirts, jackets, blouses, and fancifully shaped
collars of considerable dimensions have of late been freely made
elsewhere. To make such things entirely of lace necessitates
many modifications in the ordinary methods; the English
lace-workers are slow to adapt their work in the manner requisite,
and hence are far behind in the race to respond to the fashionable
demand. No countries succeed so well in promptly answering
the variable call of fashion as France and Belgium.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As regards trade in lace, America probably buys more from
Belgium than from France; France and England come next as
purchasers of nearly equal quantities, after which come Russia and
Italy.</p>

<p>The greatest amount of lace now made is that which issues from
machines in England, France and Germany. The total number of
persons employed in the lace industry in England in 1871 was 49,370,
and in 1901 about 34,929, of whom not more than 5000 made lace
by hand.</p>
</div>

<p>The early history<a name="fa7d" id="fa7d" href="#ft7d"><span class="sp">7</span></a> of the lace-making machine coincides
with that of the stocking frame, that machine having been
adapted about the year 1768 for producing open-looped fabrics
which had a net-like appearance. About 1786 frames for making
point nets by machinery first appear at Mansfield and later at
Ashbourne and Nottingham and soon afterwards modifications
were introduced into such frames in order to make varieties of
meshes in the point nets which were classed as figured nets.
In 1808 and 1809 John Heathcoat of Nottingham obtained
patents for machines for making bobbin net with a simpler and
more readily produced mesh than that of the point net just
mentioned. For at least thirty years thousands of women
had been employed in and about Nottingham in the embroidery
of simple ornament on net. In 1813 John Leavers began to
improve the figured net weaving machines above mentioned,
and from these the lace-making machines in use at the present
time were developed. But it was the application of the celebrated
Jacquard apparatus to such machines that enabled
manufacturers to produce all sorts of patterns in thread-work
in imitation of the patterns for hand-made lace. A French
machine called the &ldquo;dentellière&rdquo; was devised (see La Nature
for the 3rd of March 1881), and the patterns produced by it
were of plaited threads. The expense, however, attending the
production of plaited lace by the &ldquo;dentellière&rdquo; is as great as
that of pillow lace made by the hand, and so the machine has
not succeeded for ordinary trade purposes. More successful
results have been secured by the new patent circular lace machine
of Messrs. Birkin &amp; Co. of Nottingham, the productions of which,
all of simple design, cannot be distinguished from hand-made
pillow lace of the same style (see figs. 57, 58, 59).</p>

<p>Before dealing with technical details in processes of making
lace whether by hand or by the machine, the component parts of
different makes of lace may be considered. These are governed
by the ornaments or patterns, which may be so designed, as
they were in the earlier laces, that the different component parts
may touch one another without any intervening groundwork.
But as a wish arose to vary the effect of the details in a pattern
ground-works were gradually developed and at first consisted of
links or ties between the substantial parts of the pattern. The
bars or ties were succeeded by grounds of meshes, like nets.
Sometimes the substantial parts of a pattern were outlined with a
single thread or by a strongly marked raised edge of buttonhole-stitched
or of plaited work. Minute fanciful devices were then
introduced to enrich various portions of the pattern. Some
of the heavier needle-made laces resemble low relief carving in
ivory, and the edges of the relief portions are often decorated
with clusters of small loops. For the most part all this elaboration
was brought to a high pitch of variety and finish by French
designers and workers; and French terms are more usual in
speaking of details in laces. Thus the solid part of the pattern
is called the <i>toilé</i> or clothing, the links or ties are called <i>brides</i>,
the meshed grounds are called <i>réseaux</i>, the outline to the edges
of a pattern is called <i>cordonnet</i> or <i>brodé</i>, the insertions of
fanciful devices <i>modes</i>, the little loops <i>picots</i>. These terms are
applicable to the various portions of laces made with the needle,
on the pillow or by the machine.</p>

<p>The sequence of patterns in lace (which may be verified upon
referring to figs. 1 to 23) is roughly as follows. From about
1540 to 1590 they were composed of geometric forms set within
squares, or of crossed and radiating line devices, resulting in
a very open fabric, stiff and almost wiry in effect, without
<i>brides</i> or <i>réseaux</i>. From 1590 may be dated the introduction
into patterns of very conventional floral and even human
and animal forms and slender scrolls, rendered in a tape-like
texture, held together by <i>brides</i>. To the period from 1620 to
1670 belongs the development of long continuous scroll patterns
with <i>réseaux</i> and <i>brides</i>, accompanied in the case of needle-made
laces with an elaboration of details, <i>e.g.</i> <i>cordonnet</i> with
massings of <i>picots</i>. Much of these laces enriched with fillings
or <i>modes</i> was made at this time. From 1650 to 1700 the scroll
patterns gave way to arrangements of detached ornamental
details (as in Pl. VI. fig. 22): and about 1700 to 1760 more
important schemes or designs were made (as in Pl. fig. 19,
and in fig. 24 in text), into which were introduced naturalistic
renderings of garlands, flowers, birds, trophies, architectural
ornament and human figures. Grounds composed entirely
of varieties of <i>modes</i> as in the case of the <i>réseau rosacé</i> (Pl. V.
fig. 21) were sometimes made then. From 1760 to 1800 small
details consisting of bouquets, sprays of flowers, single flowers,
leaves, buds, spots and such like were adopted, and sprinkled
over meshed grounds, and the character of the texture was gauzy
and filmy (as in figs. 40 and 42). Since that time variants of
the foregoing styles of pattern and textures have been used
according to the bent of fashion in favour of simple or complex
ornamentation, or of stiff, compact or filmy textures.</p>

<p><i>Needlepoint Lace</i>.&mdash;The way in which the early Venetian
&ldquo;punto in aria&rdquo; was made corresponds with that in which
needlepoint lace is now worked. The pattern is first drawn
upon a piece of parchment. The parchment is then stitched
to two pieces of linen. Upon the leading lines drawn on the
parchment a thread is laid, and fastened through to the parchment
and linen by means of stitches, thus constructing a skeleton
thread pattern (see left-hand
part of fig. 30).
Those portions which
are to be represented as
the &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; or <i>toilé</i>
are usually worked as
indicated in the enlarged
diagram (fig. 29),
and then edged as a rule with buttonhole stitching (fig. 28).
Between these <i>toilé</i> portions of the pattern are worked ties
(<i>brides</i>) or meshes (<i>réseaux</i>), and thus the various parts united into
one fabric are wrought on to the face of the parchment pattern
and reproducing it (see right-hand part of fig. 30). A knife is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
passed between the two pieces of linen at the back of the parchment,
cutting the stitches which have passed through the parchment
and linen, and so releasing the lace itself from its pattern
parchment. In the earlier stages, the lace was made in lengths
to serve as insertions (<i>passements</i>) and also in vandykes (<i>dentelles</i>)
to serve as edgings. Later on insertions and vandykes were
made in one piece. All of such were at first of a geometric
style of pattern (Pl. figs. 3-5 and 6).</p>

<p>Following closely upon them came the freer style of design
already mentioned, without and then with links or ties&mdash;<i>brides</i>&mdash;interspersed
between the various details of the patterns (Pl. II.
fig. 7), which were of flat tape-like texture. In elaborate specimens
of this flat point lace some lace workers occasionally used
gold thread with the white thread. These flat laces (&ldquo;Punto in
Aria&rdquo;) are also called &ldquo;flat Venetian point.&rdquo; About 1640 &ldquo;rose
(raised) point&rdquo; laces began to be made (Pl. III. fig. 12). They
were done in relief and those of bold design with stronger reliefs
are called &ldquo;gros point de Venise.&rdquo; Lace of this latter class was
used for altar cloths, flounces, <i>jabots</i> or neckcloths which hung
beneath the chin over the breast (Pl. III. fig. 11), as well as for
trimming the turned-over tops of jack boots. <i>Tabliers</i> and
ladies&rsquo; aprons were also made of such lace. In these no regular
ground was introduced. All sorts of minute embellishments,
like little knots, stars and loops or <i>picots</i>, were worked on to the
irregularly arranged <i>brides</i> or ties holding the main patterns
together, and the more dainty of these raised laces (Pl. fig. 17)
exemplify the most subtle uses to which the buttonhole stitch
appears capable of being put in making ornaments. But about
1660 came laces with <i>brides</i> or ties arranged in a honeycomb
reticulation or regular ground. To them succeeded lace in
which the compact relief gave place to daintier and lighter
material combined with a ground of meshes or <i>réseau</i>. The
needle-made meshes were sometimes of single and sometimes of
double threads. A diagram is given of an ordinary method of
making such meshes (fig. 31). At the end of the 17th century
the lightest of the Venetian needlepoint
laces were made; and this class which
was of the filmiest texture is usually
known as &ldquo;point de Venise à réseau&rdquo;
(Pl. V. fig. 20<i>a</i>). It was contemporary
with the needle-made French laces of Alençon
and Argentan<a name="fa8d" id="fa8d" href="#ft8d"><span class="sp">8</span></a> that became famous
towards the latter part of the 17th century
(Pl. V. fig. 20<i>b</i>). &ldquo;Point d&rsquo;Argentan&rdquo; has been thought to
be especially distinguished on account of its delicate honeycomb
ground of hexagonally arranged <i>brides</i> (fig. 32), a peculiarity
already referred to in certain antecedent Venetian point laces.
Often intermixed with this hexagonal <i>brides</i> ground is the fine-meshed
ground or <i>réseau</i> (fig. 20<i>b</i>), which has been held to be
distinctive of &ldquo;point d&rsquo;Alençon.&rdquo; But the styles of patterns
and the methods of working them, with rich variety of insertions
or <i>modes</i>, with the <i>brodé</i> or <i>cordonnet</i> of raised buttonhole stitched
edging, are alike in Argentan and Alençon needle-made laces
(Pl. V. fig. 20<i>b</i> and fig. 32). Besides the hexagonal <i>brides</i>
ground and the ground of meshes another variety of grounding
(<i>réseau rosacé</i>) was used in certain Alençon designs. This ground
consisted of buttonhole-stitched skeleton hexagons within each
of which was worked a small hexagon of <i>toilé</i> connected with the
outer surrounding hexagon by means of six little ties or <i>brides</i>
(Pl. V. fig. 21). Lace with this particular ground has been
called &ldquo;Argentella,&rdquo; and some writers have thought that it was
a specialty of Genoese or Venetian work. But the character
of the work and the style of the floral patterns are those of
Alençon laces. The industry at Argentan was virtually an offshoot
of that nurtured at Alençon, where &ldquo;lacis,&rdquo; &ldquo;cut work&rdquo;
and &ldquo;vélin&rdquo; (work on parchment) had been made for years
before the well-developed needle-made &ldquo;point d&rsquo;Alençon&rdquo;
came into vogue under the favouring patronage of the state-aided
lace company mentioned as having been formed in 1665.
Madame Despierre in her <i>Histoire du point d&rsquo;Alençon</i> gives an
interesting and trustworthy account of the industry.</p>

<p>In Belgium, Brussels has acquired some celebrity for needle-made
laces. These, however, are chiefly in imitation of those
made at Alençon, but the <i>toilé</i> is of less compact texture and
sharpness in definition of pattern. Brussels needlepoint lace is
often worked with meshed grounds made on a pillow, and a plain
thread is used as a <i>cordonnet</i> for their patterns instead of a thread
overcast with buttonhole stitches as in the French needlepoint
laces. Note the bright sharp outline to the various ornamental

<p>Needlepoint lace has also been occasionally produced in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
England. Whilst the character of its design in the early 17th
century was rather more primitive, as a rule, than that of the
contemporary Italian, the method of its workmanship is virtually
the same and an interesting specimen of English needle-made
lace inset into an early 17th-century shirt is illustrated in fig. 33.
Specimens of needle-made work done by English school children
may be met with in samplers of the 17th and 18th centuries.
Needlepoint lace is successfully made at Youghal, Kenmare and
New Ross in Ireland, where of late years attention has been given
to the study of designs for it. The lace-making school at Burano
near Venice produces hand-made laces which are, to a great extent,
careful reproductions of the more celebrated classes of point laces,
such as &ldquo;punto in aria,&rdquo; &ldquo;rose point de Venise,&rdquo; &ldquo;point de
Venise à réseau,&rdquo; &ldquo;point d&rsquo;Alençon,&rdquo; &ldquo;point d&rsquo;Argentan&rdquo;
and others. Some good needlepoint lace is made in Bohemia
and elsewhere in the Austrian empire.</p>

<p><i>Pillow-made Lace</i>.&mdash;Pillow-made lace is built upon no substructure
corresponding with a skeleton thread pattern such as
is used for needlepoint lace, but is the representation of a pattern
obtained by twisting and plaiting threads.</p>

<p>These patterns were never so strictly geometric in style as
those adopted for the earliest point lace making from the antecedent
cut linen and drawn thread embroideries. Curved forms,
almost at the outset of pillow lace, seem to have been found easy
of execution (see lower border, Pl. II. fig. 3); its texture was
more lissom and less crisp and wiry in appearance than that of
contemporary needle-made lace. The early twisted and plaited
thread laces, which had the appearance of small cords merging
into one another, were soon succeeded by laces of similar make but
with flattened and broader lines more like fine braids or tapes
(Pl. I. fig. 2, and Pl. fig. 10). But pillow laces of this tapey
character must not be confused with laces in which actual tape
or braid is used. That peculiar class of lace-work does not arise
until after the beginning of the 17th century when the weaving
of tape is said to have commenced in Flanders. In England
this sort of tape-lace dates no farther back than 1747, when two
Dutchmen named Lanfort were invited by an English firm to
set up tape looms in Manchester.</p>

<p>The process by which lace is made on the pillow is roughly
and briefly as follows. A pattern is first drawn upon a piece
of paper or parchment. It is then
pricked with holes by a skilled &ldquo;pattern
pricker,&rdquo; who determines where the
principal pins shall be stuck for guiding
the threads. This pricked pattern
is then fastened to the pillow. The
pillow or cushion varies in shape in
different countries. Some lace-makers
use a circular pad, backed with a flat
board, in order that it may be placed
upon a table and easily moved. Other
lace-workers use a well-stuffed round
pillow or short bolster, flattened at
the two ends, so that they may hold it conveniently on their
laps. From the upper part of pillow with the pattern fastened
on it hang the threads from the bobbins. The bobbin threads
thus hang across the pattern. Fig. 34 shows the commencement,
for instance, of a double set of three-thread
plaitings. The compact portion in a pillow lace
has a woven appearance (fig. 35).</p>

<p>About the middle of the 17th century pillow
lace of formal scroll patterns somewhat in imitation
of those for point lace was made, chiefly
in Flanders. The earlier of these had grounds of
ties or <i>brides</i> and was often called &ldquo;point de Flandres&rdquo; (Pl.
fig. 14) in contradistinction to scroll patterns with a mesh
ground, which were called &ldquo;point d&rsquo;Angleterre&rdquo; (Pl. fig. 16).
Into Spain and France much lace from Venice and Flanders was
imported as well as into England, where from the 16th century
the manufacture of the simple pattern &ldquo;bone lace&rdquo; by peasants
in the midland and southern counties was still being carried on.
In Charles II.&rsquo;s time its manufacture was threatened with
extinction by the preference given to the more artistic and
finer Flemish laces. The importation of the latter was accordingly
prohibited. Dealers in Flemish lace sought to evade the
prohibitions by calling certain of their laces &ldquo;point d&rsquo;Angleterre,&rdquo;
and smuggling them into England. But smuggling was made
so difficult that English dealers were glad to obtain the services
of Flemish lace-makers and to induce them to settle in England.
It is from some such cause that the better 17th- and 18th-century
English pillow laces bear resemblance to pillow laces of Brussels,
of Mechlin and of Valenciennes.</p>

<p>As skill in the European lace-making developed soon after the
middle of the 17th century, patterns and particular plaitings
came to be identified with certain localities. Mechlin, for
instance, enjoyed a high reputation for her productions. The
chief technical features of this pillow lace lie in the plaiting of
the meshes, and the outlining of the clothing or <i>toilé</i> with a
thread <i>cordonnet</i>. The ordinary Mechlin
mesh is hexagonal in shape. Four of the
sides are of double twisted threads, two
are of four threads plaited three times
(fig. 39).</p>

<p>In Brussels pillow lace, which has
greater variety of design, the mesh is
also hexagonal; but in contrast with the
Mechlin mesh whilst four of its sides are
of double-twisted threads the other two
are of four threads plaited four times
(fig. 41). The finer specimens of Brussels
lace are remarkable for the fidelity and
grace with which the botanical forms in many of its patterns
are rendered (Pl. VI. fig. 23). These are mainly reproductions or
adaptations of designs for point d&rsquo;Alençon, and the soft quality
imparted to them in the texture of pillow-made lace contrasts
with the harder and more crisp appearance in needlepoint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
lace. An example of dainty Brussels pillow lace is given in
fig. 42. In the Brussels pillow lace a delicate modelling effect
is often imparted to the close textures of the flowers by means
of pressing them with a bone instrument which gives concave
shapes to petals and leaves, the edges
of which consist in part of slightly raised
<i>cordonnet</i> of compact plaited work.</p>

<p class="pt2">Honiton pillow lace resembles Brussels
lace, but in most of the English pillow
laces (Devonshire, Buckinghamshire,
Bedfordshire) the <i>réseau</i> is of a simple
character (fig. 43). As a rule, English
lace is made with a rather coarser thread
than that used in the older Flemish
laces. In real Flemish Valenciennes
lace there are no twisted sides to the
mesh; all are closely plaited (fig. 44)
and as a rule the shape of the mesh is
diamond but without the openings as
shown in fig. 44. No outline or <i>cordonnet</i>
to define the pattern is used in Valenciennes
lace (see fig. 45). Much lace of the Valenciennes type
(fig. 54) is made at Ypres. Besides these distinctive classes of
pillow-like laces, there are others in which equal care in plaiting
and twisting threads is displayed, though the character of
the design is comparatively simple, as for instance in ordinary
pillow laces from Italy, from the Auvergne, from Buckinghamshire,
or rude and primitive as in laces from Crete,
southern Spain and Russia. Pillow lace-making in Crete is
now said to be extinct. The laces were made chiefly of silk. The
patterns in many specimens are outlined with one, two or
three bright-coloured silken threads. Uniformity in simple
character of design may also be observed in many Italian,
Spanish, Bohemian, Swedish and Russian pillow laces (see the
lower edge of fig. 46).</p>

<p><i>Machine-made Lace</i>.&mdash;We have
already seen that a technical peculiarity
in making needlepoint lace is
that a single thread and needle are
alone used to form the pattern, and
that the buttonhole stitch and other
loopings which can be worked by
means of a needle and thread mark
a distinction between lace made in
this manner and lace made on the
pillow. For the process of pillow lace
making a series of threads are in
constant employment, plaited and
twisted the one with another. A
buttonhole stitch is not producible
by it. The Leavers lace machine
does not make either a buttonhole
stitch or a plait. An essential principle
of this machine-made work is
that the threads are twisted together
as in stocking net. The Leavers lace
machine is that generally in use at
Nottingham and Calais. French ingenuity
has developed improvements
in this machine whereby laces of delicate
thread are made; but as fast
as France makes an improvement
England follows with another, and
both countries virtually maintain an equal position in this
branch of industry. The number of threads brought into operation
in a Leavers machine is regulated by the pattern to be
produced, the threads being of two sorts, beam or warp threads

and bobbin or weft threads. Upwards of 8880 are sometimes
used, sixty pieces of lace being made simultaneously, each piece
requiring 148 threads&mdash;100 beam threads and 48 bobbin threads.
The ends of both sets of threads are fixed to a cylinder upon
which as the manufacture proceeds the lace becomes wound.
The supply of the beam or warp threads is held upon reels, and
that of the bobbins or weft threads is held in bobbins. The
beam or warp thread reels are arranged in frames or trays
beneath the stage, above which and between it and the cylinder
the twisting of the bobbin or weft with beam or warp threads
takes place. The bobbins
containing the bobbin or
weft threads are flattened
in shape so as
to pass conveniently between
the stretched beam
or warp threads. Each
bobbin can contain about
120 yds. of thread. By
most ingenious mechanism
varying degrees of
tension can be imparted
to warp and weft threads
as required. As the bobbins
or weft threads pass
like pendulums between
the warp threads the
latter are made to oscillate,
thus causing them
to become twisted with
the bobbin threads. As
the twistings take place,
combs passing through
both warp and weft
threads compress the
twistings. Thus the texture
of the clothing or
<i>toilé</i> in machine-made lace may generally be detected by
its ribbed appearance, due to the compressed twisted threads.
Figs. 47 and 48 are intended to show effects obtained by
varying the tensions of weft and warp threads. For instance,
if the weft, as threads <i>b, b, b, b</i> in fig. 47, be tight
and the warp thread slack, the warp thread <i>a</i> will be twisted
upon the weft threads. But if the warp thread <i>a</i> be tight and
the weft threads <i>b, b, b, b</i>, be slack, as in fig. 48, then the weft
threads will be twisted on the warp thread. At the same time
the twisting in both these cases arises from the conjunction of
movements given to the two sets of threads, namely, an oscillation
or movement from side to side of the beam or warp threads,
and the swinging or pendulum-like movement of the bobbin
or weft threads between the
warp threads. Fig. 49 is a
diagram of a sectional elevation
of a lace machine representing
its more essential parts.
E is the cylinder or beam upon
which the lace is rolled as made,
and upon which the ends of
both warp and weft threads are
fastened at starting. Beneath
are <i>w, w, w</i>, a series of trays
or beams, one above the other,
containing the reels of the
supplies of warp threads; <i>c, c</i>
represent the slide bars for the
passage of the bobbin <i>b</i> with
its thread from <i>k</i> to <i>k</i>, the
landing bars, one on each side
of the rank of warp threads; <i>s, t</i> are the combs which take it
in turns to press together the twistings as they are made.
The combs come away clear from the threads as soon as
they have pressed them together and fall into positions ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
to perform their pressing operations again. The contrivances
for giving each thread a particular tension and movement at
a certain time are connected with an adaptation of the Jacquard
system of pierced cards. The machine lace pattern drafter has
to calculate how many holes shall be punched in a card, and to
determine the position of
such holes. Each hole
regulates the mechanism
for giving movement to a
thread. Fig. 54 displays a
piece of hand-made Valenciennes
(Ypres) lace and
fig. 55 a corresponding piece
woven by the machine. The
latter shows the advantage
that can be gained by using
very fine gauge machines,
thus enabling a very close
imitation of the real lace to
be made by securing a very
open and clear <i>réseau</i> or net,
such as would be made on a
coarse machine, and at the same time to keep the pattern fine and
solid and standing out well from the net, as is the case with the
real lace, which cannot be done by using a coarse gauge machine.
In this example the machine used is a 16 point (that is 32 carriages
to the inch), and the ground is made half gauge, that is 8 point,
and the weaving is made the full gauge of the machine, that is
16 point. Fig. 56 gives other examples of hand- and machine-made
Valenciennes lace. The machine-made lace (<i>b</i>) imitating
the real (<i>a</i>) is made on a 14-point machine (that is 28 carriages
to the inch), the ground being 7 point and the pattern being full
gauge or 14 point. Although
the principle in these examples
of machine work is exactly
the same, in so far that they
use half gauge net and full
gauge clothing to produce the
contrast as mentioned above,
the fabrication of these two
examples is quite different,
that in fig. 55 being an example
of tight bobbins or weft, and
slack warp threads as shown
in fig. 47. Whereas the example
in fig. 56 is made with
slack bobbins or weft threads
and tight warp threads as in
fig. 48. In fig. 57 is a piece of
hand-made lace of stout thread,
very similar to much Cluny
lace made in the Auvergne and to the Buckinghamshire &ldquo;Maltese&rdquo;
lace. Close to it are specimens of lace (figs. 58 and 59) made by
the new patent circular lace machine of Messrs Birkin of Nottingham.
This machine although very slow in production actually
reproduces the real lace, at a cost slightly below that of the hand-made
lace. In another branch of lace-making by machinery,
mechanical ingenuity, combined with chemical treatment, has
led to surprising results (figs. 53 and 50). Swiss, German and
other manufacturers use machines in which a principle of the
sewing-machine is involved. A fine silken tissue is thereby
enriched with an elaborately raised cotton or thread embroidery.
The whole fabric is then treated with chemical mordants which,
whilst dissolving the silky web, do not attack the cotton or
thread embroidery. A relief embroidery possessing the appearance
of hand-made raised needlepoint lace is thus produced.

admirable counterfeit has been brought.</p>

<p>Collections of hand-made lace chiefly exist in museums and
technical institutions, as for instance the Victoria and Albert
Museum in London, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and
museums at Lyons, Nuremberg, Berlin, Turin and elsewhere.
In such places the opportunity is presented of tracing in chronological
sequence the stages of pattern and texture development.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Literature.</i>&mdash;The literature of the art of lace-making is considerable.
The series of 16th- and 17th-century lace pattern-books, of which the
more important are perhaps those by F. Vinciolo (Paris, 1587),
Cesare Vecellio (Venice, 1592), and Isabetta Catanea Parasole
(Venice, 1600), not to mention several kindred works of earlier and
later date published in Germany and the Netherlands, supplies a
large field for exploration. Signor Ongania of Venice published a
limited number of facsimiles of the majority of such works. M. Alvin
of Brussels issued a brochure in 1863 upon these patterns, and in the
same year the marquis Girolamo d&rsquo;Adda contributed two bibliographical
essays upon the same subject to the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>
(vol. xv. p. 342 seq., and vol. xvii. p. 421 seq.). In 1864 Cavaliere
A. Merli wrote a pamphlet (with illustrations) entitled <i>Origine ed
uso delle trine a filo di rete</i>; Mons F. de Fertiault compiled a brief and
rather fanciful <i>Histoire de la dentelle</i> in 1843, in which he reproduced
statements to be found in Diderot&rsquo;s <i>Encyclopédie</i>, subsequently
quoted by Roland de la Platière. The first <i>Report of the Department
of Practical Art</i> (1853) contains a &ldquo;Report on Cotton Print Works
and Lace-Making&rdquo; by Octavius Hudson, and in the first <i>Report of
the Department of Science and Art</i> are some &ldquo;Observations on Lace.&rdquo;
Reports upon the International Exhibitions of 1851 (London) and
1867 (Paris), by M. Aubry, Mrs Palliser and others contain information
concerning lace-making. The most important work first issued
upon the history of lace-making is that by Mrs Bury Palliser (<i>History
of Lace</i>, 1869). In this work the history is treated rather from an
antiquarian than a technical point of view; and wardrobe accounts,
inventories, state papers, fashionable journals, diaries, plays, poems,
have been laid under contribution with surprising diligence. A new
edition published in 1902 presents the work as entirely revised, rewritten
and enlarged under the editorship of M. Jourdain and Alice
Dryden. In 1875 the Arundel Society brought out <i>Ancient Needlepoint
and Pillow Lace</i>, a folio volume of permanently printed photographs
taken from some of the finest specimens of ancient lace
collected for the International Exhibition of 1874. These were
accompanied by a brief history of lace, written from the technical
aspect of the art, by Alan S. Cole. At the same time appeared a
bulky imperial 4to volume by Seguin, entitled <i>La Dentelle</i>, illustrated
with wood-cuts and fifty photo-typographical plates. Seguin divides
his work into four sections. The first is devoted to a sketch of the
origin of laces; the second deals with pillow laces, bibliography of
lace and a review of sumptuary edicts; the third relates to needle-made
lace; and the fourth contains an account of places where lace
has been and is made, remarks upon commerce in lace, and upon the
industry of lace makers. Without sufficient conclusive evidence
Seguin accords to France the palm for having excelled in producing
practically all the richer sorts of laces, notwithstanding that both
before and since the publication of his otherwise valuable work, many
types of them have been identified as being Italian in origin. Descriptive
catalogues are issued of the lace collections at South
Kensington Museum, at the Science and Art Museum, Dublin, and at
the Industrial Museum, Nuremberg. In 1881 a series of four Cantor
Lectures on the art of lace-making were delivered before the Society
of Arts by Alan S. Cole.</p>

<p><i>A Technical History of the Manufacture of Venetian Laces</i>, by
G. M. Urbani de Gheltof, with plates, was translated by Lady
Layard, and published at Venice by Signor Ongania. The <i>History of
Machine-wrought Hosiery and Lace Manufacture</i> (London, 1867), by
Felkin, has already been referred to. There is also a technological
essay upon lace made by machinery, with diagrams of lace stitches
and patterns (<i>Technologische Studien im sächsischen Erzgebirge</i>,
Leipzig, 1878), by Hugo Fischer. In 1886 the Libraire Renouard,
Paris, published a <i>History of Point d&rsquo;Alençon</i>, written by Madame
G. Despierres, which gives a close and interesting account of the
industry, together with a list, compiled from local records, of makers
and dealers from 1602 onwards.&mdash;<i>Embroidery and Lace: their manufacture
and history from the remotest antiquity to the present day</i>, by
Ernest Lefebure, lace-maker and administrator of the École des Arts
Décoratifs, translated and enlarged with notes by Alan S. Cole, was
published in London in 1888. It is a well-illustrated handbook for
amateurs, collectors and general readers.&mdash;Irish laces made from
modern designs are illustrated in a <i>Renascence of the Irish Art of Lace-making</i>,
published in 1888 (London).&mdash;<i>Anciennes Dentelles belges
formant la collection de feue madame Augusta Baronne Liedts et
données au Musée de Grunthuis à Bruges</i>, published at Antwerp in
1889, consists of a folio volume containing upwards of 181 phototypes&mdash;many
full size&mdash;of fine specimens of lace. The ascriptions of
country and date of origin are occasionally inaccurate, on account
of a too obvious desire to credit Bruges with being the birthplace of
all sorts of lace-work, much of which shown in this work is distinctly
Italian in style.&mdash;The <i>Encyclopaedia of Needlework</i>, by Thérèse de
Dillmont-Dornach (Alsace, 1891), is a detailed guide to several kinds
of embroidery, knitting, crochet, tatting, netting and most of the
essential stitches for needlepoint lace. It is well illustrated with
wood-cuts and process blocks.&mdash;An exhaustive history of Russian
lace-making is given in <i>La Dentelle russe</i>, by Madame Sophie
Davidoff, published at Leipzig, 1895. Russian lace is principally
pillow-work with rather heavy thread, and upwards of eighty
specimens are reproduced by photo-lithography in this book.</p>

<p>A short account of the best-known varieties of <i>Point and Pillow
Lace</i>, by A. M. S. (London, 1899), is illustrated with typical specimens
of Italian, Flemish, French and English laces, as well as with magnified
details of lace, enabling any one to identify the plaits, the twists
and loops of threads in the actual making of the fabric.&mdash;<i>L&rsquo;Industrie</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
<i>des tulles et dentelles mécaniques dans le Pas de Calais</i>, 1815-1900,
by Henri Hénon (Paris, 1900), is an important volume of over 600
pages of letterpress, interspersed with abundant process blocks of
the several kinds of machine nets and laces made at Calais since 1815.
It opens with a short account of the Arras hand-made laces, the production
of which is now almost extinct. The book was sold for the
benefit of a public subscription towards the erection of a statue in
Calais to Jacquard, the inventor of the apparatus by means of which
all figured textile fabrics are manufactured. It is of some interest to
note that machine net and lace-making at Calais owe their origin to
Englishmen, amongst whom &ldquo;le sieur R. Webster arrivé à St Pierre-les-Calais
en Décembre, 1816, venant d&rsquo;Angleterre, est l&rsquo;un des
premiers qui ont établi dans la communauté une fabrique de tulles,&rdquo;
&amp;c. <i>Lace-making in the Midlands: Past and Present</i>, by C. C.
Channer and M. E. Roberts (London, 1900) upon the lace-making
industry in Buckinghamshire, <span class="correction" title="amended from Bedforshire">Bedfordshire</span> and Northamptonshire
contains many illustrations of laces made in these counties from the
17th century to the present time. <i>Musée rétrospectif. Dentelles à
l&rsquo;exposition universelle internationale de 1900 à Paris. Rapport de
Mons. E. Lefebvre</i> contains several good illustrations, especially of
important specimens of Point de France of the 17th and 18th
centuries. <i>Le Point de France et les autres dentelliers au XVII<span class="sp">e</span> et au
XVIII<span class="sp">e</span> siècles</i>, by Madame Laurence de Laprade (Paris, 1905), brings
together much hitherto scattered information throwing light upon
operations in many localities in France where the industry has been
carried on for considerable periods. The book is well and usefully
illustrated.</p>

<p><a name="ft1d" id="ft1d" href="#fa1d"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The prevalence of fashion in the above-mentioned sorts of embroidery
during the 16th century is marked by the number of pattern-books
then published. In Venice a work of this class was issued by
Alessandro Pagannino in 1527; another of a similar nature, printed
by Pierre Quinty, appeared in the same year at Cologne; and La
<i>Fleur de la science de pourtraicture et patrons de broderie, façon arabicque
et ytalique</i>, was published at Paris in 1530. From these early dates
until the beginning of the 17th century pattern-books for embroidery
in Italy, France, Germany and England were published in great
abundance. The designs contained in many of those dating from the
early 16th century were to be worked for costumes and hangings, and
consisted of scrolls, arabesques, birds, animals, flowers, foliage, herbs
and grasses. So far, however, as their reproduction as laces might be
concerned, the execution of complicated work was involved which
none but practised lace-workers, such as those who arose a century
later, could be expected to undertake.</p>

<p><a name="ft2d" id="ft2d" href="#fa2d"><span class="fn">2</span></a> A very complete account of how these conditions began and
developed at Alençon, for instance, is given in Madame Despierre&rsquo;s

and annotated list of merchants, designers and makers of Point

by Mademoiselle de la Tousse, cousin of Madame de Sévigné, in the
middle of the 17th century, which marks the favour which foreign
laces at that time commanded amongst the leaders of French fashion.
It is fairly evident too that the French laces themselves, known
as &ldquo;bisette,&rdquo; &ldquo;gueuse,&rdquo; &ldquo;campane&rdquo; and &ldquo;mignonette,&rdquo; were
small and comparatively insignificant works, without pretence to
design.</p>

produced work of a daintier kind than that which was being made by
the Venetians. As a rule the hexagonal <i>bride</i> grounds of Alençon
laces are smaller than similar details in Venetian laces. The average
size of a diagonal taken from angle to angle in an Alençon (or so-called
Argentan) hexagon was about one-sixth of an inch, and each
side of the hexagon was about one-tenth of an inch. An idea of the
minuteness of the work can be formed from the fact that a side of a
hexagon would be overcast with some nine or ten buttonhole stitches.</p>

<span class="sc">Comte de</span> (1756-1825), French naturalist, was born at Agen in
Guienne on the 26th of December 1756. His education was
carefully conducted by his father, and the early perusal of
Buffon&rsquo;s <i>Natural History</i> awakened his interest in that branch
of study, which absorbed his chief attention. His leisure he
devoted to music, in which, besides becoming a good performer
on the piano and organ, he acquired considerable mastery of
composition, two of his operas (which were never published)
meeting with the high approval of Gluck; in 1781-1785 he also
brought out in two volumes his <i>Poétique de la musique</i>. Meantime
he wrote two treaties, <i>Essai sur l&rsquo;électricité</i> (1781) and
<i>Physique générale et particulière</i> (1782-1784), which gained him
the friendship of Buffon, who in 1785 appointed him subdemonstrator
in the Jardin du Roi, and proposed to him to become
the continuator of his <i>Histoire naturelle</i>. This continuation
was published under the titles <i>Histoire des quadrupèdes ovipares
et des serpents</i> (2 vols., 1788-1789) and <i>Histoire naturelle des
reptiles</i> (1789). After the Revolution Lacépède became a
member of the legislative assembly, but during the Reign of
Terror he left Paris, his life having become endangered by his
disapproval of the massacres. When the Jardin du Roi was
reorganized as the Jardin des Plantes, Lacépède was appointed
to the chair allocated to the study of reptiles and fishes. In
1798 he published the first volume of <i>Histoire naturelle des
poissons</i>, the fifth volume appearing in 1803; and in 1804
appeared his <i>Histoire des cétacés</i>. From this period till his death
the part he took in politics prevented him making any further
contribution of importance to science. In 1799 he became a
senator, in 1801 president of the senate, in 1803 grand chancellor
of the legion of honour, in 1804 minister of state, and at the
Restoration in 1819 he was created a peer of France. He died at
Épinay on the 6th of October 1825. During the latter part of
his life he wrote <i>Histoire générale physique et civile de l&rsquo;Europe</i>,
published posthumously in 18 vols., 1826.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA CHAISE, FRANÇOIS DE<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> (1624-1709), father confessor of
Louis XIV., was born at the château of Aix in Forey on the
25th of August 1624, being the son of Georges d&rsquo;Aix, seigneur
de la Chaise, and of Renée de Rochefort. On his mother&rsquo;s side
he was a grandnephew of Père Coton, the confessor of Henry IV.
He became a novice of the Society of Jesus before completing
his studies at the university of Lyons, where, after taking the
final vows, he lectured on philosophy to students attracted by
his fame from all parts of France. Through the influence of
Camille de Villeroy, archbishop of Lyons, Père de la Chaise was
nominated in 1674 confessor of Louis XIV., who intrusted him
during the lifetime of Harlay de Champvallon, archbishop of
Paris, with the administration of the ecclesiastical patronage of
the crown. The confessor united his influence with that of
Madame de Maintenon to induce the king to abandon his liaison
with Madame de Montespan. More than once at Easter he is
said to have had a convenient illness which dispensed him from
granting absolution to Louis XIV. With the fall of Madame
de Montespan and the ascendancy of Madame de Maintenon
his influence vastly increased. The marriage between Louis
XIV. and Madame de Maintenon was celebrated in his presence
at Versailles, but there is no reason for supposing that the
subsequent coolness between him and Madame de Maintenon
arose from his insistence on secrecy in this matter. During the
long strife over the temporalities of the Gallican Church between
Louis XIV. and Innocent XI. Père de la Chaise supported the
royal prerogative, though he used his influence at Rome to
conciliate the papal authorities. He must be held largely
responsible for the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, but not
for the brutal measures applied against the Protestants. He
exercised a moderating influence on Louis XIV.&rsquo;s zeal against
the Jansenists, and Saint-Simon, who was opposed to him in
most matters, does full justice to his humane and honourable
character. Père de la Chaise had a lasting and unalterable
affection for Fénelon, which remained unchanged by the papal
condemnation of the <i>Maximes</i>. In spite of failing faculties he
continued his duties as confessor to Louis XIV. to the end of
his long life. He died on the 20th of January 1709. The
cemetery of Père-la-Chaise in Paris stands on property acquired
by the Jesuits in 1826, and not, as is often stated, on property
personally granted to him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA CHAISE-DIEU,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> a town of central France, in the department
of Haute Loire, 29 m. N.N.W. of Le Puy by rail. Pop.
(1906) 1203. The town, which is situated among fir and pine
woods, 3500 ft. above the sea, preserves remains of its ramparts
and some houses of the 14th and 15th centuries, but owes its
celebrity to a church, which, after the cathedral of Clermont-Ferrand,
is the most remarkable Gothic building in Auvergne.
The west façade, approached by a flight of steps, is flanked by
two massive towers. The nave and aisles are of equal height
and are separated from the choir by a stone rood screen. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
choir, terminating in an apse with radiating chapel, contains the
fine tomb and statue of Clement VI., carved stalls and some
admirable Flemish tapestries of the early 16th century. There
is a ruined cloister on the south side. The church, which dates
from the 14th century, was built at the expense of Pope Clement
VI., and belonged to a powerful Benedictine abbey founded in
1043. There are spacious monastic buildings of the 18th century.
The abbey was formerly defended by fortifications, the chief
survival of which is a lofty rectangular keep to the south of the
choir. Trade in timber and the making of lace chiefly occupy the
inhabitants of the town.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA CHALOTAIS, LOUIS RENÉ DE CARADEUC DE<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (1701-1785),
French jurist, was born at Rennes, on the 6th of March
1701. He was for 60 years procureur général at the parliament
of Brittany. He was an ardent opponent of the Jesuits;
drew up in 1761 for the parliament a memoir on the constitutions
of the Order, which did much to secure its suppression
in France; and in 1763 published a remarkable &ldquo;Essay on
National Education,&rdquo; in which he proposed a programme of
scientific studies as a substitute for those taught by the Jesuits.
The same year began the conflict between the Estates of Brittany
and the governor of the province, the duc d&rsquo;Aiguillon (<i>q.v.</i>).
The Estates refused to vote the extraordinary imposts demanded
by the governor in the name of the king. La Chalotais was the
personal enemy of d&rsquo;Aiguillon, who had served him an ill turn
with the king, and when the parliament of Brittany sided with
the Estates, he took the lead in its opposition. The parliament
forbade by decrees the levy of imposts to which the Estates
had not consented. The king annulling these decrees, all the
members of the parliament but twelve resigned (October 1764
to May 1765). The government considered La Chalotais one
of the authors of this affair. At this time the secretary of state
who administered the affairs of the province, Louis Philypeaux,
duc de la Vrillière, comte de Saint-Florentin (1705-1777), received
two anonymous and abusive letters. La Chalotais was suspected
of having written them, and three experts in handwriting
declared that they were by him. The government therefore
arrested him, his son and four other members of the parliament.
The arrest made a great sensation. There was much talk of
&ldquo;despotism.&rdquo; Voltaire stated that the procureur général, in
his prison of Saint Malo, was reduced, for lack of ink, to write
his defence with a toothpick dipped in vinegar&mdash;which was
apparently pure legend; but public opinion all over France was
strongly aroused against the government. On the 16th of
November 1765 a commission of judges was named to take charge
of the trial. La Chalotais maintained that the trial was illegal;
being procureur général he claimed the right to be judged by
the parliament of Rennes, or failing this by the parliament of
Bordeaux, according to the custom of the province. The judges
did not dare to pronounce a condemnation on the evidence of
experts in handwriting, and at the end of a year, things remained
where they were at the first. Louis XV. then decided on a
sovereign act, and brought the affair before his council, which
without further formality decided to send the accused into exile.
That expedient but increased the popular agitation; <i>philosophes</i>,
members of the parliament, patriot Bretons and Jansenists
all declared that La Chalotais was the victim of the personal
hatred of the duc d&rsquo;Aiguillon and of the Jesuits. The government
at last gave way, and consented to recall the members of
the parliament of Brittany who had resigned. This parliament,
when it met again, after the formal accusation of the duc
d&rsquo;Aiguillon, demanded the recall of La Chalotais. This was
accorded in 1775, and La Chalotais was allowed to transmit
his office to his son. In this affair public opinion showed itself
stronger than the absolutism of the king. The opposition to
the royal power gained largely through it, and it may be regarded
as one of the preludes to the revolution of 1789. La Chalotais,
who was personally a violent, haughty and unsympathetic
character, died at Rennes on the 12th of July 1785.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA CHARITÉ,<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> a town of central France in the department
of Nièvre, on the right bank of the Loire, 17 m. N.N.W. of Nevers
on the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée railway. Pop. (1906) 3990.
La Charité possesses the remains of a fine Romanesque basilica,
the church of Sainte-Croix, dating from the 11th and early 12th
centuries. The plan consists of a nave, rebuilt at the end of
the 17th century, transept and choir with ambulatory and side
chapels. Surmounting the transept is an octagonal tower of
one story, and a square Romanesque tower of much beauty
flanks the main portal. There are ruins of the ramparts, which
date from the 14th century. The manufacture of hosiery, boots
and shoes, files and iron goods, lime and cement and woollen
and other fabrics are among the industries; trade is chiefly in
wood and iron.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>La Charité owes its celebrity to its priory, which was founded in
the 8th century and reorganized as a dependency of the abbey of
Cluny in 1052. It became the parent of many priories and
monasteries, some of them in England and Italy. The possession of
the town was hotly contested during the wars of religion of the
16th century, at the end of which its fortifications were dismantled.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA CHAUSSÉE, PIERRE CLAUDE NIVELLE DE<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> (1692-1754),
French dramatist, was born in Paris in 1692. In 1731
he published an <i>Épître à Clio</i>, a didactic poem in defence of
Lériget de la Faye in his dispute with Antoine Houdart de la
Motte, who had maintained that verse was useless in tragedy.
La Chaussée was forty years old before he produced his first
play, <i>La Fausse Antipathie</i> (1734). His second play, <i>Le Préjugé
à la mode</i> (1735) turns on the fear of incurring ridicule felt by
a man in love with his own wife, a prejudice dispelled in France,
according to La Harpe, by La Chaussée&rsquo;s comedy. <i>L&rsquo;École
des amis</i> (1737) followed, and, after an unsuccessful attempt
at tragedy in <i>Maximinien</i>, he returned to comedy in <i>Mélanide</i>
(1741). In <i>Mélanide</i> the type known as <i>comédie larmoyante</i>
is fully developed. Comedy was no longer to provoke laughter,
but tears. The innovation consisted in destroying the sharp
distinction then existing between tragedy and comedy in French
literature. Indications of this change had been already offered
in the work of Marivaux, and La Chaussée&rsquo;s plays led naturally
to the domestic drama of Diderot and of Sedaine. The new
method found bitter enemies. Alexis Piron nicknames the
author &ldquo;<i>le Révérend Père Chaussée</i>,&rdquo; and ridiculed him in one
of his most famous epigrams. Voltaire maintained that the
<i>comédie larmoyante</i> was a proof of the inability of the author
to produce either of the recognized kinds of drama, though he
himself produced a play of similar character in <i>L&rsquo;Enfant prodigue</i>.
The hostility of the critics did not prevent the public from shedding
tears nightly over the sorrows of La Chaussée&rsquo;s heroine.
<i>L&rsquo;École des mères</i> (1744) and <i>La Gouvernante</i> (1747) form, with
those already mentioned, the best of his work. The strict
moral aims pursued by La Chaussée in his plays seem hardly
consistent with his private preferences. He frequented the
same gay society as did the comte de Caylus and contributed
to the <i>Recueils de ces messieurs</i>. La Chaussée died on the 14th
of May 1754. Villemain said of his style that he wrote prosaic
verses with purity, while Voltaire, usually an adverse critic of
his work, said he was &ldquo;<i>un des premiers après ceux qui ont du
génie</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACHMANN, KARL KONRAD FRIEDRICH WILHELM<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span>
(1793-1851), German philologist and critic, was born at Brunswick
on the 4th of March 1793. He studied at Leipzig and
Göttingen, devoting himself mainly to philological studies.
In 1815 he joined the Prussian army as a volunteer <i>chasseur</i> and
accompanied his detachment to Paris, but did not encounter the
enemy. In 1816 he became an assistant master in the Friedrich
Werder gymnasium at Berlin, and a <i>privat-docent</i> at the university.
The same summer he became one of the principal masters in
the Friedrichs-Gymnasium of Königsberg, where he assisted
his colleague, the Germanist Friedrich Karl Köpke (1785-1865)
with his edition of Rudolf von Ems&rsquo; <i>Barlaam und Josaphat</i>
(1818), and also assisted his friend in a contemplated edition
of the works of Walther von der Vogelweide. In January 1818
he became professor extraordinarius of classical philology in
the university of Königsberg, and at the same time began to
lecture on Old German grammar and the Middle High German
poets. He devoted himself during the following seven years
to an extraordinarily minute study of those subjects, and in
1824 obtained leave of absence in order that he might search
the libraries of middle and south Germany for further materials.
In 1825 Lachmann was nominated extraordinary professor
of classical and German philology in the university of Berlin
(ordinary professor 1827); and in 1830 he was admitted a member
of the Academy of Sciences. The remainder of his laborious
and fruitful life as an author and a teacher was uneventful.
He died on the 13th of March 1851.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lachmann, who was the translator of the first volume of P. E.
Müller&rsquo;s <i>Sagabibliothek des skandinavischen Altertums</i> (1816), is a
figure of considerable importance in the history of German philology
(see Rudolf von Raumer, <i>Geschichte der germanischen Philologie</i>, 1870).
In his &ldquo;Habilitationsschrift&rdquo; <i>Über die ursprüngliche Gestalt des
Gedichts der Nibelunge Not</i> (1816), and still more in his review of
Hagen&rsquo;s <i>Nibelungen</i> and Benecke&rsquo;s <i>Bonerius</i>, contributed in 1817 to
the <i>Jenaische Literaturzeitung</i> he had already laid down the rules of
textual criticism and elucidated the phonetic and metrical principles
of Middle High German in a manner which marked a distinct
advance in that branch of investigation. The rigidly scientific character
of his method becomes increasingly apparent in the <i>Auswahl
aus den hochdeutschen Dichtern des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts</i> (1820),
in the edition of Hartmann&rsquo;s <i>Iwein</i> (1827), in those of Walther
von der Vogelweide (1827) and Wolfram von Eschenbach (1833), in
the papers &ldquo;Über das Hildebrandslied,&rdquo; &ldquo;Über althochdeutsche
Betonung und Verskunst,&rdquo; &ldquo;Über den Eingang des Parzivals,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Über drei Bruchstücke niederrheinischer Gedichte&rdquo; published in
the <i>Abhandlungen</i> of the Berlin Academy, and in <i>Der Nibelunge Not
und die Klage</i> (1826, 11th ed., 1892), which was followed by a critical
commentary in 1836. Lachmann&rsquo;s <i>Betrachtungen über Homer&rsquo;s
Ilias</i>, first published in the <i>Abhandlungen</i> of the Berlin Academy in
1837 and 1841, in which he sought to show that the <i>Iliad</i> consists of
sixteen independent &ldquo;lays&rdquo; variously enlarged and interpolated,
have had considerable influence on modern Homeric criticism
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Homer</a></span>), although his views are no longer accepted. His
smaller edition of the New Testament appeared in 1831, 3rd ed. 1846;
the larger, in two volumes, in 1842-1850. The plan of Lachmann&rsquo;s
edition, explained by himself in the <i>Stud. u. Krit.</i> of 1830, is a modification
of the unaccomplished project of Bentley. It seeks to
restore the most ancient reading current in Eastern MSS., using the
consent of the Latin authorities (Old Latin and Greek Western
Uncials) as the main proof of antiquity of a reading where the oldest
Eastern authorities differ. Besides <i>Propertius</i> (1816), Lachmann
edited <i>Catullus</i> (1829); <i>Tibullus</i> (1829); <i>Genesius</i> (1834); <i>Terentianus
Maurus</i> (1836); <i>Babrius</i> (1845); <i>Avianus</i> (1845); <i>Gaius</i> (1841-1842);
the <i>Agrimensores Romani</i> (1848-1852); <i>Lucilius</i> (edited
after his death by Vahlen, 1876); and <i>Lucretius</i> (1850). The last,
which was the main occupation of the closing years of his life, from
1845, was perhaps his greatest achievement, and has been characterized
by Munro as &ldquo;a work which will be a landmark for scholars as
long as the Latin language continues to be studied.&rdquo; Lachmann also
translated Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets (1820) and <i>Macbeth</i> (1829).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA CLOCHE, JAMES DE<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> [&rdquo;Prince James Stuart&rdquo;] (1644?-1669),
a character who was brought into the history of England
by Lord Acton in 1862 (<i>Home and Foreign Review</i>, i. 146-174:
&ldquo;The Secret History of Charles II.&rdquo;). From information
discovered by Father Boero in the archives of the Jesuits
in Rome, Lord Acton averred that Charles II., when a lad at
Jersey, had a natural son, James. The evidence follows. On
the 2nd of April 1668, as the register of the Jesuit House of
Novices at Rome attests, &ldquo;there entered Jacobus de la Cloche.&rdquo;
His baggage was exiguous, his attire was clerical. He is described
as &ldquo;from the island of Jersey, under the king of England, aged
24.&rdquo; He possessed two documents in French, purporting to
have been written by Charles II. at Whitehall, on the 25th of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
September 1665, and on the 7th of February 1667. In both
Charles acknowledges James to be his natural son, he styles
him &ldquo;James de la Cloche de Bourg du Jersey,&rdquo; and avers that
to recognize him publicly &ldquo;would imperil the peace of the
kingdoms&rdquo;&mdash;why is not apparent. A third certificate of birth,
in Latin, undated, was from Christina of Sweden, who declares
that James, previously a Protestant, has been received into the
church of Rome at Hamburg (where in 1667-1668 she was
residing) on the 29th of July 1667. The next paper purports
to be a letter from Charles II. of August 3/13 to Oliva, general
of the Jesuits. The king writes, in French, that he has long
wished to be secretly received into the church. He therefore
desires that James, his son by a young lady &ldquo;of the highest
quality,&rdquo; and born to him when he was about sixteen, should be
ordained a priest, come to England and receive him. Charles
alludes to previous attempts of his own to be secretly admitted
(1662). James must be sent secretly to London at once, and
Oliva must say nothing to Christina of Sweden (then meditating
a journey to Rome), and must never write to Charles except
when James carries the letter. Charles next writes on August
29/September 9. He is most anxious that Christina should not
meet James; if she knows Charles&rsquo;s design of changing his
creed she will not keep it secret, and Charles will infallibly
lose his life. With this letter there is another, written when the
first had been sealed. Charles insists that James must not be
accompanied, as novices were, when travelling, by a Jesuit
socius or guardian. Charles&rsquo;s wife and mother have just heard
that this is the rule, but the rule must be broken. James, who
is to travel as &ldquo;Henri de Rohan,&rdquo; must not come by way of
France. Oliva will supply him with funds. On the back of
this letter Oliva has written the draft of his brief reply to Charles
(from Leghorn, October 14, 1668). He merely says that the
bearer, a French gentleman (James spoke only French), will
inform the king that his orders have been executed. Besides
these two letters is one from Charles to James, of date August
4/14. It is addressed to &ldquo;Le Prince Stuart,&rdquo; though none of
Charles&rsquo;s bastards was allowed to bear the Stuart name. James
is told that he may desert the clerical profession if he pleases.
In that case &ldquo;you may claim higher titles from us than the
duke of Monmouth.&rdquo; (There was no higher title save prince
of Wales!) If Charles and his brother, the duke of York, die
childless, &ldquo;the kingdoms belong to you, and parliament cannot
legally oppose you, unless as, at present, they can only elect
Protestant kings.&rdquo; This letter ought to have opened the eyes
of Lord Acton and other historians who accept the myth of
James de la Cloche. Charles knew that the crown of England
was not elective, that there was no Exclusion Act, and that there
were legal heirs if he and his brother died without issue. The
last letter of Charles is dated November 18/28, and purports
to have been brought from England to Oliva by James de la
Cloche on his return to Rome. It reveals the fact that Oliva,
despite Charles&rsquo;s orders, did send James by way of France,
with a <i>socius</i> or guardian whom he was to pick up in France
on his return to England. Charles says that James is to communicate
certain matters to Oliva, and come back at once.
Oliva is to give James all the money he needs, and Charles
will later make an ample donation to the Jesuits. He acknowledges
a debt to Oliva of £800, to be paid in six months. The
reader will remark that the king has never paid a penny to
James or to Oliva, and that Oliva has never communicated
directly with Charles. The truth is that all of Charles&rsquo;s letters
are forgeries. This is certain because in all he writes frequently
as if his mother, Henrietta Maria, were in London, and constantly
in company with him. Now she had left England for France
in 1665, and to England she never returned. As the letters&mdash;including
that to &ldquo;Prince Stuart&rdquo;&mdash;are all forged, it is clear
that de la Cloche was an impostor. His aim had been to get
money from Oliva, and to pretend to travel to England, meaning
to enjoy himself. He did not quite succeed, for Oliva sent a
socius with him into France. His precautions to avoid a meeting
with Christina of Sweden were necessary. She knew no more
of him than did Charles, and would have exposed him.</p>

<p>The name of James de la Cloche appears no more in documents.
He reached Rome in December 1668, and in January a person
calling himself &ldquo;Prince James Stuart&rdquo; appears in Naples,
accompanied by a <i>socius</i> styling himself a French knight of
Malta. Both are on their way to England, but Prince James
falls ill and stays in Naples, while his companion departs. The
knight of Malta may be a Jesuit. In Naples, Prince James
marries a girl of no position, and is arrested on suspicion of being
a coiner. To his confessors (he had two in succession) he says
that he is a son of Charles II. Our sources are the despatches
of Kent, the English agent at Naples, and the <i>Lettere</i>, vol. iii.,
of Vincenzo Armanni (1674), who had his information from one
of the confessors of the &ldquo;Prince.&rdquo; The viceroy of Naples
communicated with Charles II., who disowned the impostor;
Prince James, however, was released, and died at Naples in
August 1669, leaving a wild will, in which he claims for his son,
still unborn, the &ldquo;apanage&rdquo; of Monmouth or Wales, &ldquo;which
it is usual to bestow on natural sons of the king.&rdquo; The son lived
till about 1750, a penniless pretender, and writer of begging
letters.</p>

<p>It is needless to pursue Lord Acton&rsquo;s conjectures about later
mysterious appearances of James de la Cloche at the court of
Charles, or to discuss the legend that his mother was a lady of
Jersey&mdash;or a sister of Charles! The Jersey myths may be found
in <i>The Man of the Mask</i> (1908), by Monsignor Barnes, who argued
that James was the man in the iron mask (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Iron Mask</a></span>).
Later Monsignor Barnes, who had observed that the letter of
Charles to Prince James Stuart is a forgery, noticed the impossibility
that Charles, in 1668, should constantly write of his mother
as resident in London, which she left for ever in 1665.</p>

<p>Who de la Cloche really was it is impossible to discover, but
he was a bold and successful swindler, who took in, not only the
general of the Jesuits, but Lord Acton and a generation of
guileless historians.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA CONDAMINE, CHARLES MARIE DE<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> (1701-1774), French
geographer and mathematician, was born at Paris on the 28th
of January 1701. He was trained for the military profession,
but turned his attention to science and geographical exploration.
After taking part in a scientific expedition in the Levant (1731),
he became a member with Louis Godin and Pierre Bouguer of
the expedition sent to Peru in 1735 to determine the length of a
degree of the meridian in the neighbourhood of the equator.
His associations with his principals were unhappy; the expedition
was beset by many difficulties, and finally La Condamine
separated from the rest and made his way from Quito down the
Amazon, ultimately reaching Cayenne. His was the first
scientific exploration of the Amazon. He returned to Paris
in 1744 and published the results of his measurements and travels
with a map of the Amazon in <i>Mém. de l&rsquo;académie des sciences</i>,
1745 (English translation 1745-1747). On a visit to Rome La
Condamine made careful measurements of the ancient buildings
with a view to a precise determination of the length of the Roman
foot. The journal of his voyage to South America was published
in Paris in 1751. He also wrote in favour of inoculation, and on
various other subjects, mainly connected with his work in South
America. He died at Paris on the 4th of February 1774.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACONIA<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="Lakônikê">&#923;&#945;&#954;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span>), the ancient name of the south-eastern
district of the Peloponnese, of which Sparta was the
capital. It has an area of some 1,048,000 acres, slightly greater
than that of Somersetshire, and consists of three well-marked
zones running N. and S. The valley of the Eurotas, which
occupies the centre, is bounded W. by the chain of Taygetus
(mod. Pentedaktylon, 7900 ft.), which starts from the Arcadian
mountains on the N., and at its southern extremity forms the
promontory of Taenarum (Cape Matapan). The eastern portion
of Laconia consists of a far more broken range of hill country,
rising in Mt. Parnon to a height of 6365 ft. and terminating in
the headland of Malea. The range of Taygetus is well watered
and was in ancient times covered with forests which afforded
excellent hunting to the Spartans, while it had also large iron
mines and quarries of an inferior bluish marble, as well as of the
famous <i>rosso antico</i> of Taenarum. Far poorer are the slopes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
Parnon, consisting for the most part of barren limestone uplands
scantily watered. The Eurotas valley, however, is fertile, and
produces at the present day maize, olives, oranges and mulberries
in great abundance. Laconia has no rivers of importance except
the Eurotas and its largest tributary the Oenus (mod. Kelefína).
The coast, <span class="correction" title="amended from expecially">especially</span> on the east, is rugged and dangerous.
Laconia has few good harbours, nor are there any islands lying
off its shores with the exception of Cythera (Cerigo), S. of Cape
Malea. The most important towns, besides Sparta and Gythium,
were Bryseae, Amyclae and Pharis in the Eurotas plain, Pellana
and Belbina on the upper Eurotas, Sellasia on the Oenus, Caryae
on the Arcadian frontier, Prasiae, Zarax and Epidaurus Limera
on the east coast, Geronthrae on the slopes of Parnon, Boeae,
Asopus, Helos, Las and Teuthrone on the Laconian Gulf, and
Hippola, Messa and Oetylus on the Messenian Gulf.</p>

<p>The earliest inhabitants of Laconia, according to tradition,
were the autochthonous Leleges (<i>q.v.</i>). Minyan immigrants then
settled at various places on the coast and even appear to have
penetrated into the interior and to have founded Amyclae.
Phoenician traders, too, visited the shores of the Laconian Gulf,
and there are indications of trade at a very early period between
Laconia and Crete, <i>e.g.</i> a number of blocks of green Laconian
porphyry from the quarries at Croceae have been found in the
palace of Minos at Cnossus. In the Homeric poems Laconia
appears as the realm of an Achaean prince, Menelaus, whose
capital was perhaps Therapne on the left bank of the Eurotas,
S.E. of Sparta; the Achaean conquerors, however, probably
contented themselves with a suzerainty over Laconia and part
of Messenia (<i>q.v.</i>) and were too few to occupy the whole land.
The Achaean kingdom fell before the incoming Dorians, and
throughout the classical period the history of Laconia is that
of its capital Sparta (<i>q.v.</i>). In 195 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the Laconian coast towns
were freed from Spartan rule by the Roman general T. Quinctius
Flamininus, and became members of the Achaean League. When
this was dissolved in 146 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, they remained independent under
the title of the &ldquo;Confederation of the Lacedaemonians&rdquo; or
&ldquo;of the Free-Laconians&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="koinon tôn Lakedaimoniôn">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#923;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#969;&#957;</span> or <span class="grk" title="Eleutherolakônôn">&#7960;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#974;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span>),
the supreme officer of which was a <span class="grk" title="stratêgos">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#972;&#962;</span> (general)
assisted by a <span class="grk" title="tamias">&#964;&#945;&#956;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> (treasurer). Augustus seems to have
reorganized the league in some way, for Pausanias (iii. 21, 6)
speaks of him as its founder. Of the twenty-four cities which
originally composed the league, only eighteen remained as
members by the reign of Hadrian (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Achaean League</a></span>). In
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 395 a Gothic horde under Alaric devastated Laconia, and
subsequently it was overrun by large bands of Slavic immigrants.
Throughout the middle ages it was the scene of vigorous struggles
between Slavs, Byzantines, Franks, Turks and Venetians, the
chief memorials of which are the ruined strongholds of Mistra
near Sparta, Geráki (anc. Geronthrae) and Monemvasia, &ldquo;the
Gibraltar of Greece,&rdquo; on the east coast, and Passava near
Gythium. A prominent part in the War of Independence was
played by the Maniates or Mainotes, the inhabitants of the
rugged peninsula formed by the southern part of Taygetus. They
had all along maintained a virtual independence of the Turks
and until quite recently retained their medieval customs, living
in fortified towers and practising the vendetta or blood-feud.</p>

<p>The district has been divided into two departments (nomes),
Lacedaemon and Laconia, with their capitals at Sparta and
Gythium respectively. Pop. of Laconia (1907) 61,522.</p>

<p><i>Archaeology.</i>&mdash;Until 1904 archaeological research in Laconia
was carried on only sporadically. Besides the excavations undertaken
at Sparta, Gythium and Vaphio (<i>q.v.</i>), the most important
were those at the Apollo sanctuary of Amyclae carried out by
C. Tsountas in 1890 (<span class="grk" title="Ephêm. archaiol.">&#7960;&#966;&#951;&#956;. &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#955;.</span> 1892, 1 ff.) and in 1904 by
A. Furtwängler. At Kampos, on the western side of Taygetus,
a small domed tomb of the &ldquo;Mycenean&rdquo; age was excavated in
1890 and yielded two leaden statuettes of great interest, while
at Arkina a similar tomb of poor construction was unearthed
in the previous year. Important inscriptions were found at
Geronthrae (Geráki), notably five long fragments of the <i>Edictum
Diocletiani</i>, and elsewhere. In 1904 the British Archaeological
school at Athens undertook a systematic investigation of the
ancient and medieval remains in Laconia. The results, of which
the most important are summarized in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sparta</a></span>, are
published in the British School <i>Annual</i>, x. ff. The acropolis of
Geronthrae, a hero-shrine at Angelona in the south-eastern
highlands, and the sanctuary of Ino-Pasiphae at Thalamae have
also been investigated.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACONIA,<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Belknap county,
New Hampshire, U.S.A., on both sides of the Winnepesaukee
river, 28 m. N.N.E. of Concord. Pop. (1900) 8042 (1770
foreign-born); (1910) 10,183. Laconia is served by two divisions
of the Boston &amp; Maine railway, which has a very handsome
granite passenger station (1892) and repair shops here. It is
pleasantly situated in the lake district of central New Hampshire,
and in the summer season Lake Winnisquam on the S. and W.
and Lake Winnepesaukee on the N.E. attract many visitors.
The city covers an area of 24.65 sq. m. (5.47 sq. m. annexed
since 1890). Within the city limits, and about 6 m. from its
centre, are the grounds of the Winnepesaukee Camp-Meeting
Association, and the camping place for the annual reunions
of the New Hampshire Veterans of the Civil War, both at The
Weirs, the northernmost point in the territory claimed by colonial
Massachusetts; about 2 m. from the centre of Laconia is
Lakeport (pop. 1900, 2137), which, like The Weirs, is a summer
resort and a ward in the city of Laconia. Among the public
institutions are the State School for Feeble-minded Children,
a cottage hospital and the Laconia Public Library, lodged in
the Gale Memorial Library building (1903). Another fine
building is the Congregational Church (1906). The New Hampshire
State Fish Hatchery is in Laconia. Water-power is
furnished by the river. In 1905 Laconia ranked first among the
cities of the state in the manufacture of hosiery and knit goods,
and the value of these products for the year was 48.4% of the
total value of the city&rsquo;s factory product; among its other
manufactures are yarn, knitting machines, needles, sashes and
blinds, axles, paper boxes, boats, gas and gasolene engines, and
freight, passenger and electric cars. The total value of the
factory products increased from $2,152,379 in 1900 to $3,096,878
in 1905, or 43.9%. The portion of the city N. of the river,
formerly known as Meredith Bridge, was set apart from the township
of Meredith and incorporated as a township under the name
of Laconia in 1855; a section S. of the river was taken from
the township of Gilford in 1874; and Lakeport was added in
1893, when Laconia was chartered as a city. The same Laconia
was first applied in New England to the region granted in 1629
to Mason and Gorges (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mason, John</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACONICUM<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (<i>i.e.</i> Spartan, <i>sc. balneum</i>, bath), the dry sweating
room of the Roman thermae, contiguous to the caldarium or hot
room. The name was given to it as being the only form of warm
bath that the Spartans admitted. The laconicum was usually
a circular room with niches in the axes of the diagonals and was
covered by a conical roof with a circular opening at the top,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
according to Vitruvius (v. 10), &ldquo;from which a brazen shield is
suspended by chains, capable of being so lowered and raised
as to regulate the temperature.&rdquo; The walls of the laconicum
were plastered with marble stucco and polished, and the conical
roof covered with plaster and painted blue with gold stars.
Sometimes, as in the old baths at Pompeii, the laconicum was
provided in an apse at one end of the caldarium, but as a rule
it was a separate room raised to a higher temperature and had
no bath in it. In addition to the hypocaust under the floor the
wall was lined with flue tiles. The largest laconicum, about
75 ft. in diameter, was that built by Agrippa in his thermae on
the south side of the Pantheon, and is referred to by Cassius
(liii. 23), who states that, in addition to other works, &ldquo;he constructed
the hot bath chamber which he called the Laconicum
Gymnasium.&rdquo; All traces of this building are lost; but in the
additions made to the thermae of Agrippa by Septimius Severus
another laconicum was built farther south, portions of which
still exist in the so-called Arco di Giambella.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LACORDAIRE, JEAN BAPTISTE HENRI<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> (1802-1861), French
ecclesiastic and orator, was born at Recey-sur-Ource, Côte d&rsquo;Or,
on the 12th of March 1802. He was the second of a family of
four, the eldest of whom, Jean Théodore (1801-1870), travelled
a great deal in his youth, and was afterwards professor of comparative
anatomy at Liége. For several years Lacordaire studied
at Dijon, showing a marked talent for rhetoric; this led him
to the pursuit of law, and in the local debates of the advocates
he attained a high celebrity. At Paris he thought of going on
the stage, but was induced to finish his legal training and began
to practise as an advocate (1817-1824). Meanwhile Lamennais
had published his <i>Essai sur l&rsquo;Indifférence</i>,&mdash;a passionate plea
for Christianity and in particular for Roman Catholicism as
necessary for the social progress of mankind. Lacordaire read,
and his ardent and believing nature, weary of the theological
negations of the Encyclopaedists, was convinced. In 1823
he became a theological student at the seminary of Saint
Sulpice; four years later he was ordained and became almoner
of the college Henri IV. He was called from it to co-operate
with Lamennais in the editorship of <i>L&rsquo;Avenir</i>, a journal established
to advocate the union of the democratic principle with
ultramontanism. Lacordaire strove to show that Catholicism
was not bound up with the idea of dynasty, and definitely allied
it with a well-defined liberty, equality and fraternity. But the
new propagandism was denounced from Rome in an encyclical.
In the meantime Lacordaire and Montalembert, believing that,
under the charter of 1830, they were entitled to liberty of
instruction, opened an independent free school. It was closed in
two days, and the teachers fined before the court of peers.
These reverses Lacordaire accepted with quiet dignity; but
they brought his relationship with Lamennais to a close. He now
began the course of Christian <i>conférences</i> at the Collége Stanislas,
which attracted the art and intellect of Paris; thence he went
to Nôtre Dame, and for two years his sermons were the delight
of the capital. His presence was dignified, his voice capable of
indefinite modulation, and his gestures animated and attractive.
He still preached the gospel of the people&rsquo;s sovereignty in civil
life and the pope&rsquo;s supremacy in religion, but brought to his
propagandism the full resources of a mind familiar with philosophy,
history and literature, and indeed led the reaction against
Voltairean scepticism. He was asked to edit the <i>Univers</i>, and
to take a chair in the university of Louvain, but he declined both
appointments, and in 1838 set out for Rome, revolving a great
scheme for christianizing France by restoring the old order of
St Dominic. At Rome he donned the habit of the preaching
friar and joined the monastery of Minerva. His <i>Mémoire pour
le rétablissement en France de l&rsquo;ordre des frères prêcheurs</i> was then
prepared and dedicated to his country; at the same time he
collected the materials for the life of St Dominic. When he
returned to France in 1841 he resumed his preaching at Nôtre
Dame, but he had small success in re-establishing the order of
which he ever afterwards called himself monk. His funeral
orations are the most notable in their kind of any delivered
during his time, those devoted to Marshal Drouet and Daniel
O&rsquo;Connell being especially marked by point and clearness. He
next thought that his presence in the National Assembly would
be of use to his cause; but being rebuked by his ecclesiastical
superiors for declaring himself a republican, he resigned his seat
ten days after his election. In 1850 he went back to Rome and
was made provincial of the order, and for four years laboured
to make the Dominicans a religious power. In 1854 he retired
to Sorrèze to become director of a private lyceum, and remained
there until he died on the 22nd of November 1861. He had been
elected to the Academy in the preceding year.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACQUER,<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lacker</span>, a general term for coloured and
frequently opaque varnishes applied to certain metallic objects
and to wood. The term is derived from the resin lac, which
substance is the basis of lacquers properly so called. Technically,
among Western nations, lacquering is restricted to the coating
of polished metals or metallic surfaces, such as brass, pewter and
tin, with prepared varnishes which will give them a golden,
bronze-like or other lustre as desired. Throughout the East
Indies the lacquering of wooden surfaces is universally practised,
large articles of household furniture, as well as small boxes, trays,
toys and papier-mâché objects, being decorated with bright-coloured
and variegated lacquer. The lacquer used in the East
is, in general, variously coloured sealing-wax, applied, smoothed
and polished in a heated condition; and by various devices
intricate marbled, streaked and mottled designs are produced.
Quite distinct from these, and from all other forms of lacquer,
is the lacquer work of Japan, for which see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Japan</a></span>, § <i>Art</i>.</p>

politician and writer, was born at Metz on the 9th of October
1751. He practised as a barrister in Paris; and under the
Revolution was elected as a <i>député suppléant</i> in the Constituent
Assembly, and later as deputy in the Legislative Assembly.
He belonged to the moderate party known as the &ldquo;Feuillants,&rdquo;
but after the 10th of August 1792 he ceased to take part in
public life. In 1803 he became a member of the Institute,
taking the place of La Harpe. Under the Restoration he was
one of the chief editors of the <i>Minerve française</i>; he wrote also
an essay, <i>Sur le 18 Brumaire</i> (1799), some <i>Fragments politiques
et littéraires</i> (1817), and a treatise <i>Des partis politiques et des
factions de la prétendue aristocratie d&rsquo;aujourd&rsquo;hui</i> (1819).</p>

<p>His younger brother, <span class="sc">Jean Charles Dominique de Lacretelle</span>,
called Lacretelle <i>le jeune</i> (1766-1855), historian and
journalist, was also born at Metz on the 3rd of September 1766.
He was called to Paris by his brother in 1787, and during the
Revolution belonged, like him, to the party of the <i>Feuillants</i>.
He was for some time secretary to the duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt,
the celebrated philanthropist, and afterwards joined
the staff of the <i>Journal de Paris</i>, then managed by Suard, and
where he had as colleagues André Chénier and Antoine Roucher.
He made no attempt to hide his monarchist sympathies, and
this, together with the way in which he reported the trial and
death of Louis XVI., brought him in peril of his life; to avoid this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
danger he enlisted in the army, but after Thermidor he returned
to Paris and to his newspaper work. He was involved in the
royalist movement of the 13th Vendémiaire, and condemned to
deportation after the 18th Fructidor; but, thanks to powerful
influence, he was left &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; in prison till after the 18th Brumaire,
when he was set at liberty by Fouché. Under the Empire
he was appointed a professor of history in the <i>Faculté des lettres</i>
of Paris (1809), and elected as a member of the Académie française
(1811). In 1827 he was prime mover in the protest made by
the French Academy against the minister Peyronnet&rsquo;s law on the
press, which led to the failure of that measure, but this step cost
him, as it did Villemain, his post as <i>censeur royal</i>. Under Louis
Philippe he devoted himself entirely to his teaching and literary
work. In 1848 he retired to Mâcon; but there, as in Paris, he
was the centre of a brilliant circle, for he was a wonderful causeur,
and an equally good listener, and had many interesting experiences
to recall. He died on the 26th of March 1855.
His son Pierre Henri (1815-1899) was a humorous writer and
politician of purely contemporary interest.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>J. C. Lacretelle&rsquo;s chief work is a series of histories of the 18th
century, the Revolution and its sequel: <i>Précis historique de la
Révolution française</i>, appended to the history of Rabaud St Étienne,
and partly written in the prison of La Force (5 vols., 1801-1806);
<i>Histoire de France pendant le XVIII<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i> (6 vols., 1808); <i>Histoire
de l&rsquo;Assemblée Constituante</i> (2 vols., 1821); <i>L&rsquo;Assemblée Législative</i>
(1822); <i>La Convention Nationale</i> (3 vols., 1824-1825); <i>Histoire de
France depuis la restauration</i> (1829-1835); <i>Histoire du consulat et
de l&rsquo;empire</i> (4 vols., 1846). The author was a moderate and fair-minded
man, but possessed neither great powers of style, nor striking
historical insight, nor the special historian&rsquo;s power of writing minute
accuracy of detail with breadth of view. Carlyle&rsquo;s sarcastic remark
on Lacretelle&rsquo;s history of the Revolution, that it &ldquo;exists, but does
not profit much,&rdquo; is partly true of all his books. He had been an eyewitness
of and an actor in the events which he describes, but his
testimony must be accepted with caution.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACROIX, ANTOINE FRANÇOIS ALFRED<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (1863-&emsp;&emsp;),
French mineralogist and geologist, was born at Mâcon, Saône et
Loire, on the 4th of February 1863. He took the degree of
D. ès Sc. in Paris, 1889. In 1893 he was appointed professor of
mineralogy at the <i>Jardin des Plantes</i>, Paris, and in 1896 director
of the mineralogical laboratory in the <i>École des Hautes Études</i>.
He paid especial attention to minerals connected with volcanic
phenomena and igneous rocks, to the effects of metamorphism,
and to mineral veins, in various parts of the world, notably in
the Pyrenees. In his numerous contributions to scientific
journals he dealt with the mineralogy and petrology of Madagascar,
and published an elaborate and exhaustive volume
on the eruptions in Martinique, <i>La Montagne Pelée et ses éruptions</i>
(1904). He also issued an important work entitled <i>Mineralogie
de la France et de ses Colonies</i> (1893-1898), and other works
in conjunction with A. Michel Lévy. He was elected member
of the Académie des sciences in 1904.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACROIX, PAUL<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> (1806-1884), French author and journalist,
was born in Paris on the 27th of April 1806, the son of a novelist.
He is best known under his pseudonym of P. L. Jacob, <i>bibliophile</i>,
or &ldquo;Bibliophile Jacob,&rdquo; suggested by the constant interest he
took in public libraries and books generally. Lacroix was an
extremely prolific and varied writer. Over twenty historical
romances alone came from his pen, and he also wrote a variety
of serious historical works, including a history of Napoleon III.,
and the life and times of the Tsar Nicholas I. of Russia. He
was the joint author with Ferdinand Séré of a five-volume work,
<i>Le Moyen Âge et La Renaissance</i> (1847), a standard work on the
manners, customs and dress of those times, the chief merit of
which lies in the great number of illustrations it contains. He
also wrote many monographs on phases of the history of culture.
Over the signature Pierre Dufour was published an exhaustive
<i>Histoire de la Prostitution</i> (1851-1852), which has always been
attributed to Lacroix. His works on bibliography were also
extremely numerous. In 1885 he was appointed librarian of the
Arsenal Library, Paris. He died in Paris on the 16th of October
1884.</p>

1¼ m. in length, Lacroma is remarkable for the beauty of its subtropical
vegetation. It was a favourite resort of the archduke

restored the château and park; and of the Austrian crown prince
Rudolph (1857-1889). It contains an 11th-century Benedictine

<p><span class="bold">LA CROSSE,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of La Crosse county,
Wisconsin, U.S.A., about 180 m. W.N.W. of Milwaukee, and
about 120 m. S.E. of St Paul, Minnesota, on the E. bank of the
Mississippi river, at the mouth of the Black and of the La Crosse
rivers. Pop. (1900) 28,895; (1910 census) 30,417. Of the
total population in 1900, 7222 were foreign-born, 3130 being
German and 2023 Norwegian, and 17,555 were of foreign-parentage
(both parents foreign-born), including 7853 of German
parentage, 4422 of Norwegian parentage, and 1062 of Bohemian
parentage. La Crosse is served by the Chicago &amp; North Western,
the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St Paul, the Chicago, Burlington &amp;
Quincy, the La Crosse &amp; South Eastern, and the Green Bay &amp;
Western railways, and by river steamboat lines on the Mississippi.
The river is crossed here by a railway bridge (C.M. &amp; St P.) and
wagon bridge. The city is situated on a prairie, extending back
from the river about 2½ m. to bluffs, from which fine views may
be obtained. Among the city&rsquo;s buildings and institutions are the
Federal Building (1886-1887), the County Court House (1902-1903),
the Public Library (with more than 20,000 volumes),
the City Hall (1891), the High School Building (1905-1906), the
St Francis, La Crosse and Lutheran hospitals, a Young Men&rsquo;s
Christian Association Building, a Young Women&rsquo;s Christian
Association Building, a U.S. Weather Station (1907), and a
U.S. Fish Station (1905). La Crosse is the seat of a state Normal
School (1909). Among the city&rsquo;s parks are Pettibone (an island
in the Mississippi), Riverside, Burns, Fair Ground and Myrick.
The city is the see of a Roman Catholic bishop. La Crosse is
an important lumber and grain market, and is the principal
wholesale distributing centre for a large territory in S.W. Wisconsin,
N. Iowa and Minnesota. Proximity to both pine and
hardwood forests early made it one of the most important
lumber manufacturing places in the North-west; but this
industry has now been displaced by other manufactures. The
city has grain elevators, flour mills (the value of flour and grist
mill products in 1905 was $2,166,116), and breweries (product
value in 1905, $1,440,659). Other important manufactures are
agricultural implements ($542,425 in 1905), lumber and planing
mill products, leather, woollen, knit and rubber goods, tobacco,
cigars and cigarettes, carriages, foundry and machine-shop
products, copper and iron products, cooperage, pearl buttons,
brooms and brushes. The total value of the factory product
in 1905 was $8,139,432, as against $7,676,581 in 1900. The
city owns and operates its water-works system, the wagon
bridge (1890-1891) across the Mississippi, and a toll road (2½ m.
long) to the village of La Crescent, Minn.</p>

<p>Father Hennepin and du Lhut visited or passed the site of
La Crosse as early as 1680, but it is possible that adventurous
<i>coureurs-des-bois</i> preceded them. The first permanent settlement
was made in 1841, and La Crosse was made the county-seat in
1855 and was chartered as a city in 1856.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACROSSE,<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> the national ball game of Canada. It derives its
name from the resemblance of its chief implement used, the
curved netted stick, to a bishop&rsquo;s crozier. It was borrowed
from the Indian tribes of North America. In the old days,
according to Catlin, the warriors of two tribes in their war-paint
would form the sides, often 800 or 1000 strong. The goals were
placed from 500 yds. to ½ m. apart with practically no side
boundaries. A solemn dance preceded the game, after which the
ball was tossed into the air and the two sides rushed to catch
it on &ldquo;crosses,&rdquo; similar to those now in use. The medicine-men
acted as umpires, and the squaws urged on the men by beating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
them with switches. The game attracted much attention from
the early French settlers in Canada. In 1763, after Canada
had become British, the game was used by the aborigines to
carry out an ingenious piece of treachery. On the 4th of June,
when the garrison of Fort Michilimackinac (now Mackinac) was
celebrating the king&rsquo;s birthday, it was invited by the Ottawas,
under their chief Pontiac, to witness a game of &ldquo;baggataway&rdquo;
(lacrosse). The players gradually worked their way close to the
gates, when, throwing aside their crosses and seizing their
tomahawks which the squaws suddenly produced from under
their blankets, they rushed into the fort and massacred all the
inmates except a few Frenchmen.</p>

<p>The game found favour among the British settlers, but it was
not until 1867, the year in which Canada became a Dominion,
that G. W. Beers, a prominent player, suggested that Lacrosse
should be recognized as the national game, and the National
Lacrosse Association of Canada was formed. From that time
the game has flourished vigorously in Canada and to a less
extent in the United States. In 1868 an English Lacrosse
Association was formed, but, although a team of Indians visited
the United Kingdom in 1867, it was not until sometime later
that the game became at all popular in Great Britain. Its
progress was much encouraged by visits of teams representing
the Toronto Lacrosse Club in 1888 and 1902, the methods of the
Canadians and their wonderful &ldquo;short-passing&rdquo; exciting much
admiration. In 1907 the Capitals of Ottawa visited England,
playing six matches, all of which were won by the Canadians.
The match North v. South has been played annually in England
since 1882. A county championship was inaugurated in 1905.
A North of England League, embracing ten clubs, began playing
league matches in 1897; and a match between the universities
of Oxford and Cambridge has been played annually since 1903.
A match between England and Ireland was played annually from
1881 to 1904.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Implements of the Game.&mdash;The ball is made of india-rubber sponge,
weighs between 4¼ and 4½ oz., and measures 8 to 8½ in. in circumference.
The &ldquo;crosse&rdquo; is formed of a light staff of hickory wood, the
top being bent to form a kind of hook, from the tip of which a thong
is drawn and made fast to the shaft about 2 ft. from the other end.
The oval triangle thus formed is covered with a network of gut or
rawhide, loose enough to hold the ball but not to form a bag. At no
part must the crosse measure more than 12 in. in breadth, and no
metal must be used in its manufacture. It may be of any length to
suit the player. The goals are set up not less than 100 nor more than
150 yds. apart, the goal-posts being 6 ft. high and the same distance
apart. They are set up in the middle of the &ldquo;goal-crease,&rdquo; a space
of 12 ft. square marked with chalk. A net extends from the top rail
and sides of the posts back to a point 6 ft. behind the middle of the
line between the posts. Boundaries are agreed upon by the captains.
Shoes may have india-rubber soles, but must be without spikes.</p>

<p><i>The Game.</i>&mdash;The object of the game is to send the ball, by means of
the crosse, through the enemy&rsquo;s goal-posts as many times as possible
during the two periods of play, precisely as in football and hockey.
There are twelve players of each side. In every position save that
of goal there are two men, one of each side, whose duties are to
&ldquo;mark&rdquo; and neutralize each other&rsquo;s efforts. The game is opened by
the act of &ldquo;facing,&rdquo; in which the two centres, each with his left
shoulder towards his opponents&rsquo; goal, hold their crosses, wood downwards,
on the ground, the ball being placed between them. When
the signal is given the centres draw their crosses sharply inwards in
order to gain possession of the ball. The ball may be kicked or
struck with the crosse, as at hockey, but the goal-keeper alone may
handle it, and then only to block and not to throw it. Although the
ball may be thrown with the crosse for a long distance&mdash;220 yds. is
about the limit&mdash;long throws are seldom tried, it being generally
more advantageous for a player to run with the ball resting on the
crosse, until he can pass it to a member of his side who proceeds with
the attack, either by running, passing to another, or trying to throw
the ball through the opponents&rsquo; goal. The crosse, usually held in
both hands, is made to retain the ball by an ingenious rocking motion
only acquired by practice. As there is no &ldquo;off-side&rdquo; in Lacrosse, a
player may pass the ball to the front, side or rear. No charging is
allowed, but one player may interfere with another by standing
directly in front of him (&ldquo;body-check&rdquo;), though without holding,
tripping or striking with the crosse. No one may interfere with a
player who is not in possession of the ball. Fouls are penalized either
by the suspension of the offender until a goal has been scored or until
the end of the game; or by allowing the side offended against a
&ldquo;free position.&rdquo; When a &ldquo;free position&rdquo; is awarded each player
must stand in the position where he is, excepting the goal-keeper
who may get back to his goal, and any opponent who may be nearer
the player getting the ball than 5 yds.; this player must retire to
that distance from the one who has been given the &ldquo;free position,&rdquo;
who then proceeds with the game as he likes when the referee says
&ldquo;play.&rdquo; This penalty may not be carried out nearer than 10 yds.
from the goal. If the ball crosses a boundary the referee calls
&ldquo;stand,&rdquo; and all players stop where they are, the ball being then
&ldquo;faced&rdquo; not less than 4 yds. within the boundary line by the two
nearest players.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACTANTIUS FIRMIANUS<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 260-<i>c.</i> 340), also called Lucius
Caelius (or Caecilius) Lactantius Firmianus, was a Christian
writer who from the beauty of his style has been called the
&ldquo;Christian Cicero.&rdquo; His history is very obscure. He was born
of heathen parents in Africa about 260, and became a pupil of
Arnobius, whom he far excelled in style though his knowledge
of the Scriptures was equally slight. About 290 he went to
Nicomedia in Bithynia while Diocletian was emperor, to teach
rhetoric, but found little work to do in that Greek-speaking
city. In middle age he became a convert to Christianity, and
about 306 he went to Gaul (Trèves) on the invitation of Constantine
the Great, and became tutor to his eldest son, Crispus. He
probably died about 340.</p>

<p>Lactantius&rsquo; chief work, <i>Divinarum Institutionum Libri Septem</i>,
is an &ldquo;apology&rdquo; for and an introduction to Christianity,
written in exquisite Latin, but displaying such ignorance as to
have incurred the charge of favouring the Arian and Manichaean
heresies. It seems to have been begun in Nicomedia about
304 and finished in Gaul before 311. Two long eulogistic
addresses and most of the brief apostrophes to the emperor are
from a later hand, which has added some dualistic touches.
The seven books of the institutions have separate titles given to
them either by the author or by a later editor. The first, <i>De
Falsa Religione</i>, and the second, <i>De Origine Erroris</i>, attack the
polytheism of heathendom, show the unity of the God of creation
and providence, and try to explain how men have been corrupted
by demons. The third book, <i>De Falsa Sapientia</i>, describes
and criticizes the various systems of prevalent philosophy.
The fourth book, <i>De Vera Sapientia et Religione</i>, insists upon the
inseparable union of true wisdom and true religion, and maintains
that this union is made real in the person of Christ. The fifth
book, <i>De Justitia</i>, maintains that true righteousness is not to be
found apart from Christianity, and that it springs from piety which
consists in the knowledge of God. The sixth book, <i>De Vero
Cultu</i>, describes the true worship of God, which is righteousness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
and consists chiefly in the exercise of Christian love towards
God and man. The seventh book, <i>De Vita Beata</i>, discusses,
among a variety of subjects, the chief good, immortality, the
second advent and the resurrection. Jerome states that
Lactantius wrote an epitome of these <i>Institutions</i>, and such a
work, which may well be authentic, was discovered in MS. in the
royal library at Turin in 1711 by C. M. Pfaff.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>Institutions</i> Lactantius wrote several treatises:
(1) <i>De Ira Dei</i>, addressed to one Donatus and directed against
the Epicurean philosophy. (2) <i>De Opificio Dei sive de Formatione
Hominis</i>, his earliest work, and one which reveals very little
Christian influence. He exhorts a former pupil, Demetrianus,
not to be led astray by wealth from virtue; and he demonstrates
the providence of God from the adaptability and beauty of the
human body. (3) A celebrated incendiary treatise, <i>De Mortibus
Persecutorum</i>, which describes God&rsquo;s judgments on the persecutors
of his church from Nero to Diocletian, and has served as a model
for numberless writings. <i>De Mort. Persecut.</i> is not in the earlier
editions of Lactantius; it was discovered and printed by Baluze
in 1679. Many critics ascribe it to an unknown Lucius Caecilius;
there are certainly serious differences of grammar, style and
temper between it and the writings already mentioned. It was
probably composed in Nicomedia, <i>c.</i> 315. Jerome speaks of
Lactantius as a poet, and several poems have been attributed
to him:&mdash;<i>De Ave Phoenice</i> (which Harnack thinks makes use of
1 Clement), <i>De Passione Domini</i> and <i>De Resurrectione</i> (<i>Domini</i>)
or <i>De Pascha ad Felicem Episcopum</i>. The first of these may
belong to Lactantius&rsquo;s heathen days, the second is a product of
the Renaissance (<i>c.</i> 1500), the third was written by Venantius
Fortunatus in the 6th century.</p>

a solution of ordinary ammonium lactate. It is identical with
&alpha;-hydroxypropionic acid in almost every respect, except with
regard to its physical properties. The fourth isomer, formed
by the action of <i>Bacillus laevo-lacti</i> on cane-sugar, resembles
sarcolactic acid in every respect, except in its action on polarized
light (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stereoisomerism</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Fermentation</i>, or <i>ethylidene lactic acid</i>, was isolated by K. W. Scheele
(<i>Trans. Stockholm Acad.</i> 1780) from sour milk (Lat. <i>lac</i>, <i>lactis</i>, milk,
whence the name). About twenty-four years later Bouillon Lagrange,
and independently A. F. de Fourcroy and L. N. Vauquelin,
maintained that Scheele&rsquo;s new acid was nothing but impure acetic
acid. This notion was combated by J. Berzelius, and finally refuted
(in 1832) by J. v. Liebig and E. Mitscherlich, who, by the elementary
analyses of lactates, proved the existence of this acid as a distinct
compound. It may be prepared by the lactic fermentation of
starches, sugars, gums, &amp;c., the sugar being dissolved in water and
acidified by a small quantity of tartaric acid and then fermented by
the addition of sour milk, with a little putrid cheese. Zinc carbonate
is added to the mixture (to neutralize the acid formed), which is kept
warm for some days and well stirred. On boiling and filtering the
product, zinc lactate crystallizes out of the solution. The acid may
also be synthesized by the decomposition of alanine (&alpha;-aminopropionic
acid) by nitrous acid (K. Strecker, <i>Ann.</i>, 1850, 75, p. 27); by
the oxidation of propylene glycol (A. Wurtz); by boiling &alpha;-chlorpropionic
acid with caustic alkalis, or with silver oxide and water; by
the reduction of pyruvic acid with sodium amalgam; or from
acetaldehyde by the cyanhydrin reaction (J. Wislicenus, <i>Ann.</i>, 1863,
128, p. 13)</p>

decomposes on distillation under ordinary atmospheric pressure;
but at very low pressures (about 1 mm.) it distils at about 85° C., and
then sets to a crystalline solid, which melts at about 18° C. It
possesses the properties both of an acid and of an alcohol. When
heated with dilute sulphuric acid to 130° C., under pressure, it is
resolved into formic acid and acetaldehyde. Chromic acid oxidizes
it to acetic acid and carbon dioxide; potassium permanganate
oxidizes it to pyruvic acid; nitric acid to oxalic acid, and a mixture
of manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid to acetaldehyde and carbon
dioxide. Hydrobromic acid converts it into &alpha;-brompropionic acid,
and hydriodic acid into propionic acid.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA CUEVA, JUAN DE<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (1550?-1609?), Spanish dramatist
and poet, was born at Seville, and towards 1579 began writing
for the stage. His plays, fourteen in number, were published
in 1588, and are the earliest manifestations of the dramatic
methods developed by Lope de Vega. Abandoning the Senecan
model hitherto universal in Spain, Cueva took for his themes
matters of national legend, historic tradition, recent victories
and the actualities of contemporary life: this amalgam of epical
and realistic elements, and the introduction of a great variety
of metres, prepared the way for the Spanish romantic drama
of the 17th century. A peculiar interest attaches to <i>El Infamador</i>,
a play in which the character of Leucino anticipates the classic
type of Don Juan. As an initiative force, Cueva is a figure
of great historical importance; his epic poem, <i>La Conquista
de Bética</i> (1603), shows his weakness as an artist. The last
work to which his name is attached is the <i>Ejemplar poético</i>
(1609), and he is believed to have died shortly after its
publication.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LACY, FRANZ MORITZ,<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> Count (1725-1801), Austrian field
marshal, was born at St Petersburg on the 21st of October
1725. His father, Peter, Count Lacy, was a distinguished
Russian soldier, who belonged to an Irish family, and had
followed the fortunes of the exiled James II. Franz Moritz was
educated in Germany for a military career, and entered the
Austrian service. He served in Italy, Bohemia, Silesia and the
Netherlands during the War of the Austrian Succession, was
twice wounded, and by the end of the war was a lieut.-colonel.
At the age of twenty-five he became full colonel and chief of an
infantry regiment. In 1756 with the opening of the Seven
Years&rsquo; War he was again on active service, and in the first
battle (Lobositz) he distinguished himself so much that he was
at once promoted major-general. He received his third wound
on this occasion and his fourth at the battle of Prague in 1757.
Later in 1757 Lacy bore a conspicuous part in the great victory
of Breslau, and at Leuthen, where he received his fifth wound,
he covered the retreat of the defeated army. Soon after this
began his association with Field-Marshal Daun, the new
generalissimo of the empress&rsquo;s forces, and these two commanders,
powerfully assisted later by the genius of Loudon, made head
against Frederick the Great for the remainder of the war. A
general staff was created, and Lacy, a lieutenant field-marshal
at thirty-two, was made chief of staff (quartermaster-general)
to Daun. That their cautiousness often degenerated into timidity
may be admitted&mdash;Leuthen and many other bitter defeats had
taught the Austrians to respect their great opponent&mdash;but they
showed at any rate that, having resolved to wear out the enemy
by Fabian methods, they were strong enough to persist in their
resolve to the end. Thus for some years the life of Lacy, as of
Daun and Loudon, is the story of the war against Prussia (see
Seven Years&rsquo; War). After Hochkirch (October 15, 1758)
Lacy received the grand cross of the Maria Theresa order. In
1759 both Daun and Lacy fell into disfavour for failing to win
victories, and Lacy owed his promotion to Feldzeugmeister only
to the fact that Loudon had just received this rank for the
brilliant conduct of his detachment at Kunersdorf. His responsibilities
told heavily on Lacy in the ensuing campaigns, and his
capacity for supreme command was doubted even by Daun,
who refused to give him the command when he himself was
wounded at the battle of Torgau.</p>

<p>After the peace of Hubertusburg a new sphere of activity
was opened, in which Lacy&rsquo;s special gifts had the greatest scope.
Maria Theresa having placed her son, the emperor Joseph II.,
at the head of Austrian military affairs, Lacy was made a field-marshal,
and given the task of reforming and administering
the army (1766). He framed new regulations for each arm, a
new code of military law, a good supply system. As the result
of his work the Austrian army was more numerous, far better
equipped, and cheaper than it had ever been before. Joseph
soon became very intimate with his military adviser, but this did
not prevent his mother, after she became estranged from the
young emperor, from giving Lacy her full confidence. His
activities were not confined to the army. He was in sympathy
with Joseph&rsquo;s innovations, and was regarded by Maria Theresa
as a prime mover in the scheme for the partition of Poland.
But his self-imposed work broke down Lacy&rsquo;s health, and in
1773, in spite of the remonstrances of Maria Theresa and of the
emperor, he laid down all his offices and went to southern France.
On returning he was still unable to resume office, though as
an unofficial adviser in political and military matters he was
far from idle. In the brief and uneventful War of the Bavarian
Succession, Lacy and Loudon were the chief Austrian commanders
against the king of Prussia, and when Joseph II. at Maria
Theresa&rsquo;s death, became the sovereign of the Austrian dominions
as well as emperor, Lacy remained his most trusted friend.
More serious than the War of the Bavarian Succession was the
Turkish war which presently broke out. Lacy was now old and
worn out, and his tenure of command therein was not marked
by any greater measure of success than in the case of the other
Austrian generals. His active career was at an end, although
he continued his effective interest in the affairs of the state
and the army throughout the reign of Joseph&rsquo;s successor,
Leopold I. His last years were spent in retirement at his
castle of Neuwaldegg near Vienna. He died at Vienna on the
24th of November 1801.</p>

Academy at Athens in succession to Arcesilaus about 241 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
Though some regard him as the founder of the New Academy,
the testimony of antiquity is that he adhered in general to the
theory of Arcesilaus, and, therefore, that he belonged to the
Middle Academy. He lectured in a garden called the Lacydeum,
which was presented to him by Attalus I. of Pergamum, and for
twenty-six years maintained the traditions of the Academy.
He is said to have written treatises, but nothing survives.
Before his death he voluntarily resigned his position to his pupils,
Euander and Telecles. Apart from a number of anecdotes
distinguished rather for sarcastic humour than for probability,
Lacydes exists for us as a man of refined character, a hard worker
and an accomplished orator. According to Athenaeus (x. 438)
and Diogenes Laërtius (iv. 60) he died from excessive drinking,
but the story is discredited by the eulogy of Eusebius (<i>Praep.

<p><span class="bold">LADAKH AND BALTISTAN,<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> a province of Kashmir, India.
The name Ladak, commonly but less correctly spelt Ladakh,
and sometimes Ladag, belongs primarily to the broad valley of
the upper Indus in West Tibet, but includes several surrounding
districts in political connexion with it; the present limits are
between 75° 40&prime; and 80° 30&prime; E., and between 32° 25&prime; and 36° N.
It is bounded N. by the Kuenlun range and the slopes of the
Karakoram, N.W. and W. by the dependency of Baltistan or
Little Tibet, S.W. by Kashmir proper, S. by British Himalayan
territory, and E. by the Tibetan provinces of Ngari and Rudok.
The whole region lies very high, the valleys of Rupshu in the
south-east being 15,000 ft., and the Indus near Leh 11,000 ft.,
while the average height of the surrounding ranges is 19,000 ft.
The proportion of arable and even possible pasture land to barren
rock and gravel is very small. Pop., including Baltistan (1901)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
165,992, of whom 30,216 in Ladakh proper are Buddhists, whereas
the Baltis have adopted the Shiah form of Islam.</p>

<p>The natural features of the country may be best explained by
reference to two native terms, under one or other of which every
part is included; viz. <i>changtang</i>, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;northern, or high plain,&rdquo;
where the amount of level ground is considerable, and <i>rong</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;deep valley,&rdquo; where the contrary condition prevails.
The former predominates in the east, diminishing gradually
westwards. There, although the vast alluvial deposits which
once filled the valley to a remarkably uniform height of about
15,000 ft. have left their traces on the mountain sides, they have
undergone immense denudation, and their débris now forms
secondary deposits, flat bottoms or shelving slopes, the only
spots available for cultivation or pasture. These masses of
alluvium are often either metamorphosed to a subcrystalline
rock still showing the composition of the strata, or simply consolidated
by lime.</p>

<p>Grand scenery is exceptional, for the valleys are confined,
and from the higher points the view is generally of a confused
mass of brown or yellow hills, absolutely barren, and of no great
apparent height. The parallelism characteristic of the Himalayan
ranges continues here, the direction being north-west and south-east.
A central range divides the Indus valley, here 4 to 8 m.
wide, from that of its north branch the Shyok, which with its
fertile tributary valley of Nubra is again bounded on the north
by the Karakoram. This central ridge is mostly syenitic gneiss,
and north-east from it are found, successively, Silurian slates,
Carboniferous shales and Triassic limestones, the gneiss recurring
at the Turkestan frontier. The Indus lies along the line which
separates the crystalline rocks from the Eocene sandstones and
shales of the lower range of hills on the left bank, the lofty
mountains behind them consisting of parallel bands of rocks
from Silurian to Cretaceous.</p>

<p>Several lakes in the east districts at about 14,000 ft. have been
of much greater extent, and connected with the river systems of
the country, but they are now mostly without outlet, saline,
and in process of desiccation.</p>

<p>Leh is the capital of Ladakh, and the road to Leh from Srinagar
lies up the lovely Sind valley to the sources of the river at the
Zoji La Pass (11,300 ft.) in the Zaskar range. This is the range
which, skirting the southern edge of the upland plains of Deosai
in Baltistan, divides them from the valley of Kashmir, and then
continues to Nanga Parbat (26,620 ft.) and beyond that mountain
stretches to the north of Swat and Bajour. To the south-east it
is an unbroken chain till it merges into the line of snowy peaks
seen from Simla and the plains of India&mdash;the range which reaches
past Chini to the famous peaks of Gangotri, Nandadevi and
Nampa. It is the most central and conspicuous range in the
Himalaya. The Zoji La, which curves from the head of the Sind
valley on to the bleak uplands of Dras (where lies the road to the
trough of the Indus and Leh), is, in spite of its altitude, a pass
on which little snow lies; but for local accumulations, it would
be open all the year round. It affords a typical instance of that
cutting-back process by which a river-head may erode a channel
through a watershed into the plateau behind, there being no steep
fall towards the Indus on the northern side of the range. From
the Zoji La the road continues by easy gradients, following the
line of the Dras drainage, to the Indus, when it turns up the
valley to Leh. From Leh there are many routes into Tibet,
the best known being that from the Indus valley to the Tibetan
plateau, by the Chang La, to Lake Pangkong and Rudok (14,000
ft.). Rudok occupies a forward position on the western Tibetan
border analogous to that of Leh in Kashmir. The chief trade
route to Lhasa from Leh, however, follows the line offered by
the valleys of the Indus and the Brahmaputra (or Tsanpo),
crossing the divide between these rivers north of Lake Manasarowar.</p>

<p>The observatory at Leh is the most elevated observatory
in Asia. &ldquo;The atmosphere of the Indus valley is remarkably
clear and transparent, and the heat of the sun is very great.
There is generally a difference of more than 60° between the reading
of the exposed sun thermometer <i>in vacuo</i> and the air temperature
in the shade, and this difference has occasionally exceeded
90°.... The mean annual temperature at Leh is 40°, that of
the coldest months (January and February) only 18° and 19°,
but it rises rapidly from February to July, in which month it
reaches 62° with a mean diurnal maximum of 80° both in that
month and August, and an average difference of 29° or 30°
between the early morning and afternoon. The mean highest
temperature of the year is 90°, varying between 84° and 93°
in the twelve years previous to 1893. On the other hand, in
the winter the minimum thermometer falls occasionally below
0°, and in 1878 reached as low as 17° below zero. The extreme
range of recorded temperature is therefore not less than 110°.
The air is as dry as Quetta, and rather more uniformly so....
The amount of rain and snow is insignificant. The average
rain (and snow) fall is only 2.7 in. in the year.&rdquo;<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The winds are
generally light, and depend on the local direction of the valleys.
At Leh, which stands at the entrance of the valley leading to
the Kardang Pass, the most common directions are between
south and west in the daytime and summer, and from north-east
in the night, especially in the later months of the year.
In January and February the air is generally calm, and April
and May are the most windy months of the year.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Vegetation is confined to valleys and sheltered spots, where a
stunted growth of tamarisk and <i>Myricaria</i>, <i>Hippophae</i> and <i>Elaeagnus</i>,
furze, and the roots of <i>burtsi</i>, a salsolaceous plant, supply the traveller
with much-needed firewood. The trees are the pencil cedar (<i>Juniperus
excelsa</i>), the poplar and willow (both extensively planted, the latter
sometimes wild), apple, mulberry, apricot and walnut. Irrigation is
skilfully managed, the principal products being wheat, a beardless
variety of barley called <i>grim</i>, millet, buckwheat, pease, beans and
turnips. Lucerne and prangos (an umbelliferous plant) are used as
fodder.</p>

<p>Among domestic animals are the famous shawl goat, two kinds of
sheep, of which the larger (<i>huniya</i>) is used for carrying burdens, and
is a principal source of wealth, the yak and the dso, a valuable
hybrid between the yak and common cow. Among wild animals are
the kiang or wild ass, ibex, several kinds of wild sheep, antelope
(<i>Pantholops</i>), marmot, hare and other Tibetan fauna.</p>

<p>The present value of the trade between British India and Tibet
passing through Ladakh is inconsiderable. Ladakh, however, is improving
in its trade prospects apart from Tibet. It is curious that
both Ladakh and Tibet import a considerable amount of treasure,
for on the borders of western Tibet and within a radius of 100
or 200 m. of Leh there centres a gold-mining industry which
apparently only requires scientific development to render it enormously
productive. Here the surface soil has been for many centuries
washed for gold by bands of Tibetan miners, who never work deeper
than 20 to 50 ft., and whose methods of washing are of the crudest
description. They work in winter, chiefly because of the binding
power of frost on the friable soil, suffering great hardships and obtaining
but a poor return for their labour. But the remoteness of
Ladakh and its extreme altitude still continue to bar the way to
substantial progress, though its central position naturally entitles
it to be a great trade mart.</p>

<p>The adjoining territory of Baltistan forms the west extremity of
Tibet, whose natural limits here are the Indus from its abrupt southward
bend in 74° 45&prime; E., and the mountains to the north and west,
separating a comparatively peaceful Tibetan population from the
fiercer Aryan tribes beyond. Mahommedan writers about the 16th
century speak of Baltistan as &ldquo;Little Tibet,&rdquo; and of Ladakh as
&ldquo;Great Tibet,&rdquo; thus ignoring the really Great Tibet altogether.
The Balti call Gilgit &ldquo;a Tibet,&rdquo; and Dr Leitner says that the Chilasi
call themselves Bot or Tibetans; but, although these districts may
have been overrun by the Tibetans, or have received rulers of that
race, the ethnological frontier coincides with the geographical one
given. Baltistan is a mass of lofty mountains, the prevailing formation
being gneiss. In the north is the Baltoro glacier, the largest out
of the arctic regions, 35 m. long, contained between two ridges whose
highest peaks to the south are 25,000 and to the north 28,265 ft.
The Indus, as in Lower Ladakh, runs in a narrow gorge, widening for
nearly 20 m. after receiving the Shyok. The capital, Skardu, a scattered
collection of houses, stands here, perched on a rock 7250 ft. above the
sea. The house roofs are flat, occupied only in part by a second
story, the remaining space being devoted to drying apricots, the
chief staple of the main valley, which supports little cultivation.
But the rapid slope westwards is seen generally in the vegetation.
Birch, plane, spruce and <i>Pinus excelsa</i> appear; the fruits are finer,
including pomegranate, pear, peach, vine and melon, and where
irrigation is available, as in the North Shigar, and at the deltas of the
tributary valleys, the crops are more luxuriant and varied.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The earliest notice of Ladakh is by the Chinese
pilgrim Fa-hien, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 400, who, travelling in search of a purer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
faith, found Buddhism flourishing there, the only novelty to
him being the prayer-cylinder, the efficacy of which he declares
is incredible. Ladakh formed part of the Tibetan empire until
its disruption in the 10th century, and since then has continued
ecclesiastically subject, and sometimes tributary, to Lhasa.
Its inaccessibility saved it from any Mussulman invasion until
1531, when Sultan Said of Kashgar marched an army across
the Karakoram, one division fighting its way into Kashmir
and wintering there. Next year they invaded eastern Tibet,
where nearly all perished from the effects of the climate.</p>

<p>Early in the 17th century Ladakh was invaded by its Mahommedan
neighbours of Baltistan, who plundered and destroyed the
temples and monasteries; and again, in 1685-1688, by the Sokpa,
who were expelled only by the aid of the lieutenant of Aurangzeb
in Kashmir, Ladakh thereafter becoming tributary. The gyalpo
or king then made a nominal profession of Islam, and allowed
a mosque to be founded at Leh, and the Kashmiris have ever
since addressed his successors by a Mahommedan title. When
the Sikhs took Kashmir, Ladakh, dreading their approach, offered
allegiance to Great Britain. It was, however, conquered and
annexed in 1834-1841 by Gulab Singh of Jammu&mdash;the unwar-like
Ladakhis, even with nature fighting on their side, and against
indifferent generalship, being no match for the Dogra troops.
These next turned their arms successfully against the Baltis
(who in the 18th century were subject to the Mogul), and were
then tempted to revive the claims of Ladakh to the Chinese
provinces of Rudok and Ngari. This, however, brought down
an army from Lhasa, and after a three days&rsquo; fight the Indian
force was almost annihilated&mdash;chiefly indeed by frostbite and
other sufferings, for the battle was fought in mid-winter, 15,000
ft. above the sea. The Chinese then marched on Leh, but were
soon driven out again, and peace was finally made on the basis
of the old frontier. The widespread prestige of China is illustrated
by the fact that tribute, though disguised as a present, is paid
to her, for Ladakh, by the maharaja of Kashmir.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LADISLAUS [I.],<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> Saint (1040-1095), king of Hungary, the
son of Béla I., king of Hungary, and the Polish princess Richeza,
was born in Poland, whither his father had sought refuge,
but was recalled by his elder brother Andrew I. to Hungary
(1047) and brought up there. He succeeded to the throne
on the death of his uncle Geza in 1077, as the eldest member of
the royal family, and speedily won for himself a reputation
scarcely inferior to that of Stephen I., by nationalizing Christianity
and laying the foundations of Hungary&rsquo;s political greatness.
Instinctively recognizing that Germany was the natural enemy
of the Magyars, Ladislaus formed a close alliance with the pope
and all the other enemies of the emperor Henry IV., including the
anti-emperor Rudolph of Swabia and his chief supporter Welf,
duke of Bavaria, whose daughter Adelaide he married. She
bore him one son and three daughters, one of whom, Piriska,
married the Byzantine emperor John Comnenus. The collapse
of the German emperor in his struggle with the pope left Ladislaus
free to extend his dominions towards the south, and colonize
and Christianize the wildernesses of Transylvania and the lower
Danube. Hungary was still semi-savage, and her native barbarians
were being perpetually recruited from the hordes of Pechenegs,
Kumanians and other races which swept over her during
the 11th century. Ladislaus himself had fought valiantly in
his youth against the Pechenegs, and to defend the land against
the Kumanians, who now occupied Moldavia and Wallachia
as far as the Alt, he built the fortresses of Turnu-Severin and
Gyula Féhervár. He also planted in Transylvania the Szeklers,
the supposed remnant of the ancient Magyars from beyond the
Dnieper, and founded the bishoprics of Nagy-Várad, or Gross-Wardein,
and of Agram, as fresh foci of Catholicism in south
Hungary and the hitherto uncultivated districts between the
Drave and the Save. He subsequently conquered Croatia,
though here his authority was questioned by the pope, the
Venetian republic and the Greek emperor. Ladislaus died
suddenly in 1095 when about to take part in the first Crusade.
No other Hungarian king was so generally beloved. The whole
nation mourned for him for three years, and regarded him as a
saint long before his canonization. A whole cycle of legends
is associated with his name.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LADISLAUS IV.,<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> The Kumanian (1262-1290), king of Hungary,
was the son of Stephen V., whom he succeeded in 1272. From
his tenth year, when he was kidnapped from his father&rsquo;s court
by the rebellious vassals, till his assassination eighteen years
later, his whole life, with one bright interval of military glory
was unrelieved tragedy. His minority, 1272-1277, was an
alternation of palace revolutions and civil wars, in the course
of which his brave Kumanian mother Elizabeth barely contrived
to keep the upper hand. In this terrible school Ladislaus matured
precociously. At fifteen he was a man, resolute, spirited, enterprising,
with the germs of many talents and virtues, but rough,
reckless and very imperfectly educated. He was married
betimes to Elizabeth of Anjou, who had been brought up at the
Hungarian court. The marriage was a purely political one,
arranged by his father and a section of the Hungarian magnates
to counterpoise hostile German and Czech influences. During
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
the earlier part of his reign, Ladislaus obsequiously followed the
direction of the Neapolitan court in foreign affairs. In Hungary
itself a large party was in favour of the Germans, but the civil
wars which raged between the two factions from 1276 to 1278
did not prevent Ladislaus, at the head of 20,000 Magyars and
Kumanians, from co-operating with Rudolph of Habsburg in the
great battle of Durnkrüt (August 26th, 1278), which destroyed,
once for all, the empire of the P&#345;emyslidae. A month later
a papal legate arrived in Hungary to inquire into the conduct
of the king, who was accused by his neighbours, and many of
his own subjects, of adopting the ways of his Kumanian kinsfolk
and thereby undermining Christianity. Ladislaus was not really
a pagan, or he would not have devoted his share of the spoil of
Durnkrüt to the building of the Franciscan church at Pressburg,
nor would he have venerated as he did his aunt St Margaret.
Political enmity was largely responsible for the movement against
him, yet the result of a very careful investigation (1279-1281)
by Philip, bishop of Fermo, more than justified many of the
accusations brought against Ladislaus. He clearly preferred
the society of the semi-heathen Kumanians to that of the
Christians; wore, and made his court wear, Kumanian dress;
surrounded himself with Kumanian concubines, and neglected
and ill-used his ill-favoured Neapolitan consort. He was finally
compelled to take up arms against his Kumanian friends, whom
he routed at Hodmézö (May 1282) with fearful loss; but,
previously to this, he had arrested the legate, whom he subsequently
attempted to starve into submission, and his conduct
generally was regarded as so unsatisfactory that, after repeated
warnings, the Holy See resolved to supersede him by his Angevin
kinsfolk, whom he had also alienated, and on the 8th of August
1288 Pope Nicholas IV. proclaimed a crusade against him. For
the next two years all Hungary was convulsed by a horrible civil
war, during which the unhappy young king, who fought for his
heritage to the last with desperate valour, was driven from one
end of his kingdom to the other like a hunted beast. On the
25th of December 1289 he issued a manifesto to the lesser gentry,
a large portion of whom sided with him, urging them to continue
the struggle against the magnates and their foreign supporters;
but on the 10th of July 1290 he was murdered in his camp
at Korosszeg by the Kumanians, who never forgave him for
deserting them.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LADISLAUS V.<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (1440-1457), king of Hungary and Bohemia,
the only son of Albert, king of Hungary, and Elizabeth, daughter
of the emperor Sigismund, was born at Komárom on the 22nd
of February 1440, four months after his father&rsquo;s death, and was
hence called Ladislaus Posthumus. The estates of Hungary
had already elected Wladislaus III. of Poland their king, but
Ladislaus&rsquo;s mother caused the holy crown to be stolen from its
guardians at Visegrad, and compelled the primate to crown the
infant king at Székesfejérvár on the 15th of May 1440; whereupon,
for safety&rsquo;s sake, she placed the child beneath the guardianship
of his uncle the emperor Frederick III. On the death of
Wladislaus III. (Nov. 10th, 1444), Ladislaus V. was elected
king by the Hungarian estates, though not without considerable
opposition, and a deputation was sent to Vienna to induce the
emperor to surrender the child and the holy crown; but it was
not till 1452 that Frederick was compelled to relinquish both.
The child was then transferred to the pernicious guardianship
of his maternal grandfather Ulrich Cillei, who corrupted him
soul and body and inspired him with a jealous hatred of the
Hunyadis. On the 28th of October 1453 he was crowned king
of Bohemia, and henceforth spent most of his time at Prague
and Vienna. He remained supinely indifferent to the Turkish
peril; at the instigation of Cillei did his best to hinder the
defensive preparations of the great Hunyadi, and fled from the
country on the tidings of the siege of Belgrade. On the death
of Hunyadi he made Cillei governor of Hungary at the diet of
Futtak (October 1456), and when that traitor paid with his life
for his murderous attempt on Laszló Hunyadi at Belgrade,
Ladislaus procured the decapitation of young Hunyadi (16th of
March 1457), after a mock trial which raised such a storm in
Hungary that the king fled to Prague, where he died suddenly
(Nov. 23rd, 1457), while making preparations for his marriage
with Magdalena, daughter of Charles VII. of France. He is
supposed to have been poisoned by his political opponents in
Bohemia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LADO ENCLAVE,<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> a region of the upper Nile formerly administered
by the Congo Free State, but since 1910 a province
of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. It has an area of about 15,000
sq. m., and a population estimated at 250,000 and consisting
of Bari, Madi, Kuku and other Nilotic Negroes. The enclave is
bounded S.E. by the north-west shores of Albert Nyanza&mdash;as
far south as the port of Mahagi&mdash;E. by the western bank of the
Nile (Bahr-el-Jebel) to the point where the river is intersected
by 5° 30&prime; N., which parallel forms its northern frontier from the
Nile westward to 30° E. This meridian forms the west frontier
to 4° N., the frontier thence being the Nile-Congo watershed to
the point nearest to Mahagi and from that point direct to Albert
Nyanza.</p>

<p>The country is a moderately elevated plateau sloping northward
from the higher ground marking the Congo-Nile watershed.
The plains are mostly covered with bush, with stretches of forest
in the northern districts. Traversing the plateau are two
parallel mountainous chains having a general north to south
direction. One chain, the Kuku Mountains (average height
2000 ft.), approaches close to the Nile and presents, as seen from
the river, several apparently isolated peaks. At other places
these mountains form precipices which stretch in a continuous
line like a huge wall. From Dufile in 3° 34&prime; N. to below the
Bedden Rapids in 4° 40&prime; N. the bed of the Nile is much obstructed
and the river throughout this reach is unnavigable (see Nile).
Below the Bedden Rapids rises the conical hill of Rejaf, and
north of that point the Nile valley becomes flat. Ranges of hill,
however, are visible farther westwards, and a little north of 5° N.
is Jebel Lado, a conspicuous mountain 2500 ft. high and some
12 m. distant from the Nile. It has given its name to the district,
being the first hill seen from the Nile in the ascent of some
1000 m. from Khartum. On the river at Rejaf, at Lado, and at
Kiro, 28 m. N. of Lado, are government stations and trading
establishments. The western chain of hills has loftier peaks
than those of Kuku, Jebel Loka being about 3000 ft. high.
This western chain forms a secondary watershed separating
the basin of the Yei, a large river, some 400 m. in length, which
runs almost due north to join the Nile, from the other streams
of the enclave, which have an easterly or north-easterly direction
and join the Nile after comparatively short courses.</p>

<p>The northern part of the district was first visited by Europeans
in 1841-1842, when the Nile was ascended by an expedition
despatched by Mehemet Ali to the foot of the rapids at Bedden.
The neighbouring posts of Gondokoro, on the east bank of the
Nile, and Lado, soon became stations of the Khartum ivory
and slave traders. After the discovery of Albert Nyanza by
Sir Samuel Baker in 1864, the whole country was overrun by
Arabs, Levantines, Turks and others, whose chief occupation was
slave raiding. The region was claimed as part of the Egyptian
Sudan, but it was not until the arrival of Sir Samuel Baker at
Gondokoro in 1870 as governor of the equatorial provinces,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
that any effective control of the slave traders was attempted.
Baker was succeeded by General C. G. Gordon, who established
a separate administration for the Bahr-el-Ghazal. In 1878
Emin Pasha became governor of the Equatorial Province, a
term henceforth confined to the region adjoining the main
Nile above the Sobat confluence, and the region south of the
Bahr-el-Ghazal province. (The whole of the Lado Enclave
thus formed part of Emin&rsquo;s old province.) Emin made his
headquarters at Lado, whence he was driven in 1885 by the
Mahdists. He then removed to Wadelai, a station farther south,
but in 1889 the pasha, to whose aid H. M. Stanley had conducted
an expedition from the Congo, evacuated the country and with
Stanley made his way to the east coast. While the Mahdists
remained in possession at Rejaf, Great Britain in virtue of her
position in Uganda claimed the upper Nile region as within the
British sphere; a claim admitted by Germany in 1890. In
February 1894 the union jack was hoisted at Wadelai, while in
May of the same year Great Britain granted to Leopold II., as
sovereign of the Congo State, a lease of large areas lying west of
the upper Nile inclusive of the Bahr-el-Ghazal and Fashoda.
Pressed however by France, Leopold II. agreed to occupy only
that part of the leased area east of 30° E. and south of 5° 30&prime; N.,
and in this manner the actual limits of the Lado Enclave, as it
was thereafter called, were fixed. Congo State forces had
penetrated to the Nile valley as early as 1891, but it was not
until 1897, when on the 17th of February Commandant Chaltin
inflicted a decisive defeat on the Mahdists at Rejaf, that their
occupation of the Lado Enclave was assured. After the withdrawal
of the French from Fashoda, Leopold II. revived (1899)
his claim to the whole of the area, leased to him in 1894. In
this claim he was unsuccessful, and the lease, by a new agreement
made with Great Britain in 1906, was annulled (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Africa</a></span>, § 5).
The king however retained the enclave, with the stipulation
that six months after the termination of his reign it should be
handed over to the Anglo-Sudanese government (see <i>Treaty
Series</i>, No. 4, 1906).</p>

250 to 350 ft. The level of Lake Ladoga is 55 ft. above the

system, whilst Valamo island is made up of a rock which Russian
geologists describe as orthoclastic hypersthenite. The granite and
marble of Serdobol, and the sandstone of Putilovo, are much used
for buildings at St Petersburg; copper and tin from the Pitkäranta
mine are exported.</p>

<p>No fewer than seventy rivers enter Ladoga, pouring into it the
waters of numberless smaller lakes which lie at higher levels round it.
The Volkhov, which conveys the waters of Lake Ilmen, is the largest;
Lake Onega discharges its waters by the Svir; and the Saima
system of lakes of eastern Finland contributes the Vuoxen and
Taipale rivers; the Syas brings the waters from the smaller lakes
and marshes of the Valdai plateau. Ladoga discharges its surplus
water by means of the Neva, which flows from its south-western
corner into the Gulf of Finland, rolling down its broad channel
104,000 cubic ft. of water per second.</p>

<p>The water of Ladoga is very pure and cold; in May the surface
temperature does not exceed 36° Fahr., and even in August it reaches
only 50° and 53°, the average yearly temperature of the air at
Valamo being 36.8°. The lake begins to freeze in October, but it is
only about the end of December that it is frozen in its deeper parts;
and it remains ice-bound until the end of March, though broad icefields
continue to float in the middle of the lake until broken up by
gales. Only a small part of the Ladoga ice is discharged by the Neva;
but it is enough to produce in the middle of June a return of cold
in the northern capital. The thickness of the ice does not exceed
3 or 4 ft.; but during the alternations of cold and warm weather,
with strong gales, in winter, stacks of ice, 70 and 80 ft. high, are
raised on the shores and on the icefields. The water is in continuous
rotatory motion, being carried along the western shore from north
to south, and along the eastern from south to north. The vegetation
on the shores is poor; immense forests, which formerly covered them,
are now mostly destroyed. But the fauna of the lake is somewhat
rich; a species of seal which inhabits its waters, as well as several
species of arctic crustaceans, recall its former connexion with the
Arctic Ocean. The sweet water <i>Diatomaceae</i> which are found in
great variety in the ooze of the deepest parts of the lake also have an
arctic character.</p>

<p>Fishing is very extensively carried on. Navigation, which is
practicable for only one hundred and eighty days in the year, is rather
difficult owing to fogs and gales, which are often accompanied, even
in April and September, with snow-storms. The prevailing winds
blow from N.W. and S.W.; N.E. winds cause the water to rise in the
south-western part, sometimes 3 to 5 ft. Steamers ply regularly in
two directions from St Petersburg&mdash;to the monasteries of Konnevitz
and Valamo, and to the mouth of the Svir, whence they go up that
river to Lake Onega and Petrozavodsk; and small vessels transport
timber, firewood, planks, iron, kaolin, granite, marble, fish, hay and
various small wares from the northern shore to Schlüsselburg, and
thence to St Petersburg. Navigation on the lake being too dangerous
for small craft, canals with an aggregate length of 104 m. were
dug in 1718-1731, and others in 1861-1886 having an aggregate
length of 101 m. along its southern shore, uniting with the Neva at
Schlüsselburg the mouths of the rivers Volkhov, Syas and Svir, all
links in the elaborate system of canals which connect the upper
Volga with the Gulf of Finland.</p>

<p>The population (35,000) on the shores of the lake is sparse, and the
towns&mdash;Schlüsselburg (5285 inhabitants in 1897); New Ladoga
(4144); Kexholm (1325) and Serdobol&mdash;are small. The monasteries
of Valamo, founded in 992, on the island of the same name, and
Konnevskiy, on Konnevitz island, founded in 1393, are visited every
year by many thousands of pilgrims.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LADY<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>hlaéfdige</i>, Mid. Eng. <i>láfdi</i>, <i>l&#257;vedi</i>; the first part
of the word is <i>hláf</i>, loaf, bread, as in the corresponding <i>hláford</i>,
lord; the second part is usually taken to be from the root dig-,
to knead, seen also in &ldquo;dough&rdquo;; the sense development from
bread-kneader, bread-maker, to the ordinary meaning, though
not clearly to be traced historically, may be illustrated by that
of &ldquo;lord&rdquo;), a term of which the main applications are two,
(1) as the correlative of &ldquo;lord&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>) in certain of the usages
of that word, (2) as the correlative of &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>).
The primary meaning of mistress of a household is, if not obsolete,
in present usage only a vulgarism. The special use of the word
as a title of the Virgin Mary, usually &ldquo;Our Lady,&rdquo; represents
the Lat. <i>Domina Nostra</i>. In Lady Day and Lady Chapel the
word is properly a genitive, representing the O. Eng. <i>hlaéfdigan</i>.
As a title of nobility the uses of &ldquo;lady&rdquo; are mainly paralleled by
those of &ldquo;lord.&rdquo; It is thus a less formal alternative to the full
title giving the specific rank, of marchioness, countess, viscountess
or baroness, whether as the title of the husband&rsquo;s
rank by right or courtesy, or as the lady&rsquo;s title in her own right.
In the case of the younger sons of a duke or marquess, who by
courtesy have lord prefixed to their Christian and family name,
the wife is known by the husband&rsquo;s Christian and family name
with Lady prefixed, <i>e.g.</i> Lady John B.; the daughters of dukes,
marquesses and earls are by courtesy Ladies; here that title
is prefixed to the Christian and family name of the lady, <i>e.g.</i> Lady
Mary B., and this is preserved if the lady marry a commoner,
<i>e.g.</i> Mr and Lady Mary C. &ldquo;Lady&rdquo; is also the customary
title of the wife of a baronet or knight; the proper title, now
only used in legal documents or on sepulchral monuments, is
&ldquo;dame&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>); in the latter case the usage is to prefix Dame
to the Christian name of the wife followed by the surname of the
husband, thus Dame Eleanor B., but in the former, Lady with
the surname of the husband only, Sir A. and Lady B. During
the 15th and 16th centuries &ldquo;princesses&rdquo; or daughters of the
blood royal were usually known by their Christian names with
&ldquo;the Lady&rdquo; prefixed, <i>e.g.</i> the Lady Elizabeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span></p>

<p>While &ldquo;lord&rdquo; has retained its original application as a title
of nobility or rank without extension, an example which has been
followed in Spanish usage by &ldquo;don,&rdquo; &ldquo;lady&rdquo; has been extended
in meaning to be the feminine correlative of &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo;
throughout its sense developments, and in this is paralleled by
<i>Dame</i> in German, <i>madame</i> in French, <i>donna</i> in Spanish, &amp;c.
It is the general word for any woman of a certain social position
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gentleman</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LADYBRAND,<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> a town of the Orange Free State, 80 m. E. of
Bloemfontein by rail. Another railway connects it with Natal
via Harrismith. Pop. (1904) 3862, of whom 2334 were whites.
The town is pleasantly situated at the foot of a flat-topped hill
(the Platberg), about 4 m. W. of the Caledon river, which
separates the province from Basutoland. Ladybrand is the
centre of a rich arable district, has a large wheat market and is
also a health resort, the climate, owing to the proximity of the
Maluti Mountains, being bracing even during the summer
months (November-March). Coal and petroleum are found in
the neighbourhood. It is named after the wife of Sir J. H. Brand,
president of the Orange Free State.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LADY-CHAPEL,<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> the chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin
and attached to churches of large size. Generally the chapel was
built eastward of the high altar and formed a projection from the
main building, as in Winchester, Salisbury, Exeter, Wells, St
Albans, Chichester, Peterborough and Norwich cathedrals,&mdash;in
the two latter cases now destroyed. The earliest Lady-chapel
built was that in the Saxon cathedral of Canterbury; this was
transfered in the rebuilding by Archbishop Lanfranc to the
west end of the nave, and again shifted in 1450 to the chapel on
the east side of the north transept. The Lady-chapel at Ely
cathedral is a distinct building attached to the north transept;
at Rochester the Lady-chapel is west of the south transept.
Probably the largest Lady-chapel was that built by Henry III.
in 1220 at Westminster Abbey, which was 30 ft. wide, much in
excess of any foreign example, and extended to the end of the
site now occupied by Henry VII.&rsquo;s chapel. Among other
notable English examples of Lady-chapels are those at Ottery-St-Mary,
Thetford, Bury St Edmund&rsquo;s, Wimborne, Christ-church,
Hampshire; in Compton Church, Surrey, and Compton
Martin, Somersetshire, and Darenth, Kent, it was built over the
chancel. At Croyland Abbey there were two Lady-chapels.
Lady-chapels exist in most of the French cathedrals and churches,
where they form part of the chevet; in Belgium they were not
introduced before the 14th century; in some cases they are
of the same size as the other chapels of the chevet, but in others,
probably rebuilt at a later period, they became much more
important features, and in Italy and Spain during the Renaissance
period constitute some of its best examples.</p>

calendar marking any event in the Virgin Mary&rsquo;s life, but now
restricted to the feast of the Annunciation, held on the 25th of
March in each year. Lady Day was in medieval and later times
the beginning of the legal year in England. In 1752 this was
altered to the 1st of January, but the 25th of March remains one

<p><span class="bold">LADYSMITH,<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> a town of Natal, 189 m. N.W. of Durban by
rail, on the left bank of the Klip tributary of the Tugela. Pop.
(1904) 5568, of whom 2269 were whites. It lies 3284 ft. above
the sea and is encircled by hills, while the Drakensberg are some
30 m. distant to the N.W. Ladysmith is the trading centre of
northern Natal, and is the chief railway junction in the province,
the main line from the south dividing here. One line crosses Van
Reenen&rsquo;s pass into the Orange Free State, the other runs northwards
to the Transvaal. There are extensive railway workshops.
Among the public buildings are the Anglican church and the
town hall. The church contains tablets with the names of 3200
men who perished in the defence and relief of the town in the
South African War (see below), while the clock tower of the
town hall, partially destroyed by a Boer shell, is kept in its
damaged condition.</p>

<p>Ladysmith, founded in 1851, is named after Juana, Lady
Smith, wife of Sir Harry Smith, then governor of Cape Colony.
It stands near the site of the camp of the Dutch farmers who in
1848 assembled for the purpose of trekking across the Drakensberg.
Here they were visited by Sir Harry Smith, who induced
the majority of the farmers to remain in Natal. The growth of
the town, at first slow, increased with the opening of the railway
from Durban in 1886 and the subsequent extension of the line
to Johannesburg.</p>

<p>In the first and most critical stage of the South African War
of 1899-1902 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Transvaal</a></span>) Ladysmith was the centre of the
struggle. During the British concentration on the town there
were fought the actions of Talana (or Dundee) on the 20th,
Elandslaagte on the 21st and Rietfontein on the 24th of October
1899. On the 30th of October the British sustained a serious
defeat in the general action of Lombard&rsquo;s Kop or Farquhar&rsquo;s
Farm, and Sir George White decided to hold the town, which had
been fortified, against investment and siege until he was relieved
directly or indirectly by Sir Redvers Buller&rsquo;s advance. The
greater portion of Buller&rsquo;s available troops were despatched to
Natal in November, with a view to the direct relief of Ladysmith,
which meantime the Boers had closely invested. His first attempt
was repelled on the 15th of December in the battle of Colenso,
his second on the 24th of January 1900 by the successful Boer
counterstroke against Spion Kop, and his third was abandoned
without serious fighting (Vaalkranz, Feb. 5). But two or
three days after Vaalkranz, almost simultaneously with Lord
Roberts&rsquo;s advance on Bloemfontein Sir Redvers Buller resumed
the offensive in the hills to the east of Colenso, which he gradually
cleared of the enemy, and although he was checked after reaching
the Tugela below Colenso (Feb. 24) he was finally successful
in carrying the Boer positions (Pieter&rsquo;s Hill) on the 27th and
relieving Ladysmith, which during these long and anxious
months (Nov. 1-Feb. 28) had suffered very severely from want
of food, and on one occasion (Caesar&rsquo;s Camp, Jan. 6, 1900) had
only with heavy losses and great difficulty repelled a powerful
Boer assault. The garrison displayed its unbroken resolution
on the last day of the investment by setting on foot a mobile
column, composed of all men who were not too enfeebled to
march out, in order to harass the Boer retreat. This expedition
was however countermanded by Buller.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAELIUS,<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> the name of a Roman plebeian family, probably
settled at Tibur (Tivoli). The chief members were:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaius Laelius</span>, general and statesman, was a friend of the
elder Scipio, whom he accompanied on his Spanish campaign
(210-206 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). In Scipio&rsquo;s consulship (205), Laelius went with
him to Sicily, whence he conducted an expedition to Africa.
In 203 he defeated the Massaesylian prince Syphax, who,
breaking his alliance with Scipio, had joined the Carthaginians,
and at Zama (202) rendered considerable service in command of
the cavalry. In 197 he was plebeian aedile and in 196 praetor of
Sicily. As consul in 190 he was employed in organizing the
recently conquered territory in Cisalpine Gaul. Placentia and
Cremona were repeopled, and a new colony founded at Bononia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
He is last heard of in 170 as ambassador to Transalpine Gaul.
Though little is known of his personal qualities, his intimacy
with Scipio is proof that he must have been a man of some
importance. Silius Italicus (<i>Punica</i>, xv. 450) describes him as
a man of great endowments, an eloquent orator and a brave
soldier.</p>

</div>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Gaius Laelius</span>, is known chiefly as the friend of the
younger Scipio, and as one of the speakers in Cicero&rsquo;s <i>De senectute</i>,
<i>De amicitia</i> (or <i>Laelius</i>) and <i>De Republica</i>. He was surnamed
<i>Sapiens</i> (&ldquo;the wise&rdquo;), either from his scholarly tastes or because,
when tribune, he &ldquo;prudently&rdquo; withdrew his proposal (151 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
for the relief of the farmers by distributions of land, when he
saw that it was likely to bring about disturbances. In the third
Punic War (147) he accompanied Scipio to Africa, and distinguished
himself at the capture of the Cothon, the military
harbour of Carthage. In 145 he carried on operations with
moderate success against Viriathus in Spain; in 140 he was
elected consul. During the Gracchan period, as a staunch
supporter of Scipio and the aristocracy, Laelius became obnoxious
to the democrats. He was associated with P. Popillius Laenas
in the prosecution of those who had supported Tiberius Gracchus,
and in 131 opposed the bill brought forward by C. Papirius Carbo
to render legal the election of a tribune to a second year of office.
The attempts of his enemies, however, failed to shake his reputation.
He was a highly accomplished man and belonged to the
so-called &ldquo;Scipionic circle.&rdquo; He studied philosophy under the
Stoics Diogenes Babylonius and Panaetius of Rhodes; he was
a poet, and the plays of Terence, by reason of their elegance of
diction, were sometimes attributed to him. With Scipio he was
mainly instrumental in introducing the study of the Greek
language and literature into Rome. He was a gifted orator,
though his refined eloquence was perhaps less suited to the
forum than to the senate. He delivered speeches <i>De Collegiis</i>
(145) against the proposal of the tribune C. Licinius Crassus to
deprive the priestly colleges of their right of co-optation and to
transfer the power of election to the people; <i>Pro Publicanis</i>
(139), on behalf of the farmers of the revenue; against the
proposal of Carbo noticed above; <i>Pro Se</i>, a speech in his own
defence, delivered in answer to Carbo and Gracchus; funeral
orations, amongst them two on his friend Scipio. Much information
is given concerning him in Cicero, who compares him to
Socrates.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaius Popillius Laenas</span>, consul in 172 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He was sent
to Greece in 174 to allay the general disaffection, but met with
little success. He took part in the war against Perseus, king
of Macedonia (Livy xliii. 17, 22). When Antiochus Epiphanes,
king of Syria, invaded Egypt, Laenas was sent to arrest his
progress. Meeting him near Alexandria, he handed him the
decree of the senate, demanding the evacuation of Egypt.
Antiochus having asked time for consideration, Laenas drew a
circle round him with his staff, and told him he must give an
answer before he stepped out of it. Antiochus thereupon
submitted (Livy xlv. 12; Polybius xxix. 11; Cicero, <i>Philippica</i>,
viii. 8; Vell. Pat. i. 10).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Publius Popillius Laenas</span>, son of the preceding. When
consul in 132 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he incurred the hatred of the democrats
by his harsh measures as head of a special commission appointed
to take measures against the accomplices of Tiberius Gracchus.
In 123 Gaius Gracchus brought in a bill prohibiting all such
commissions, and declared that, in accordance with the old
laws of appeal, a magistrate who pronounced sentence of death
against a citizen, without the people&rsquo;s assent, should be guilty
of high treason. It is not known whether the bill contained a
retrospective clause against Laenas, but he left Rome and
sentence of banishment from Italy was pronounced against him.
After the restoration of the aristocracy the enactments against
him were cancelled, and he was recalled (121).</p>

was born at Laaren in Holland. The influence of a long stay
in Rome begun at an early age is seen in his landscape and backgrounds,
but in his subjects he remained true to the Dutch
tradition, choosing generally lively scenes from peasant life, as
markets, feasts, bowling scenes, farriers&rsquo; shops, robbers, hunting
scenes and peasants with cattle. From this taste, or from his
personal deformity, he was nicknamed Bamboccio by the
Italians. On his return to Holland about 1639, he lived chiefly
at Amsterdam and Haarlem, in which latter city he died in 1674
or 1675. His pictures are marked by skilful composition and
good drawing; he was especially careful in perspective. His
colouring, according to Crowe, is &ldquo;generally of a warm, brownish
tone, sometimes very clear, but oftener heavy, and his execution
broad and spirited.&rdquo; Certain etched plates are also attributed
to him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAESTRYGONES,<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> a mythical race of giants and cannibals.
According to the <i>Odyssey</i> (x. 80) they dwelt in the farthest north,
where the nights were so short that the shepherd who was
driving out his flock met another driving it in. This feature of
the tale contains some hint of the long nightless summer in the
Arctic regions, which perhaps reached the Greeks through the
merchants who fetched amber from the Baltic coasts. Odysseus
in his wanderings arrived at the coast inhabited by the Laestrygones,
and escaped with only one ship, the rest being sunk by
the giants with masses of rock. Their chief city was Telepylus,
founded by a former king Lamus, their ruler at that time being
Antiphates. This is a purely fanciful name, but Lamus takes
us into a religious world where we can trace the origin of the
legend, and observe the god of an older religion becoming the
subject of fairy tales (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lamia</a></span>) in a later period.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The later Greeks placed the country of the Laestrygones in Sicily,
to the south of Aetna, near Leontini; but Horace (<i>Odes</i>, iii. 16. 34)
and other Latin authors speak of them as living in southern Latium,
near Formiae, which was supposed to have been founded by Lamus.</p>

(1425-1498), Italian humanist, was born at Salerno. He studied
at Rome under Laurentius Valla, whom he succeeded (1457)
as professor of eloquence in the Gymnasium Romanum. About
this time he founded an academy, the members of which adopted
Greek and Latin names, met on the Quirinal to discuss classical
questions and celebrated the birthday of Romulus. Its constitution
resembled that of an ancient priestly college, and Laetus
was styled pontifex maximus. The pope (Paul II.) viewed these
proceedings with suspicion, as savouring of paganism, heresy
and republicanism. In 1468 twenty of the academicians were
arrested during the carnival; Laetus, who had taken refuge
in Venice, was sent back to Rome, imprisoned and put to the
torture, but refused to plead guilty to the charges of infidelity
and immorality. For want of evidence, he was acquitted
and allowed to resume his professorial duties; but it was forbidden
to utter the name of the academy even in jest. Sixtus
IV. permitted the resumption of its meetings, which continued
to be held till the sack of Rome (1527) by Constable Bourbon
during the papacy of Clement VII. Laetus continued to teach
in Rome until his death on the 9th of June 1498. As a teacher,
Laetus, who has been called the first head of a philological
school, was extraordinarily successful; in his own words, like
Socrates and Christ, he expected to live on in the person of his
pupils, amongst whom were many of the most famous scholars
of the period. His works, written in pure and simple Latin,
were published in a collected form (<i>Opera Pomponii Laeti
varia</i>, 1521). They contain treatises on the Roman magistrates,
priests and lawyers, and a compendium of Roman history from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
the death of the younger Gordian to the time of Justin III.
Laetus also wrote commentaries on classical authors, and promoted
the publication of the editio princeps of Virgil at Rome
in 1469.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAEVIUS<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> (? <i>c.</i> 80 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), a Latin poet of whom practically
nothing is known. The earliest reference to him is perhaps in
Suetonius (<i>De grammaticis</i>, 3), though it is not certain that the
Laevius Milissus there referred to is the same person. Definite
references do not occur before the 2nd century (Fronto, <i>Ep. ad
M. Caes.</i> i. 3; Aulus Gellius, <i>Noct. Att.</i> ii. 24, xii. 10, xix. 9;
Apuleius, <i>De magia</i>, 30; Porphyrion, <i>Ad Horat. carm.</i> iii. 1, 2).
Some sixty miscellaneous lines are preserved (see Bährens,
<i>Fragm. poët. rom.</i> pp. 287-293), from which it is difficult to see
how ancient critics could have regarded him as the master of
Ovid or Catullus. Gellius and Ausonius state that he composed
an <i>Erotopaegnia</i>, and in other sources he is credited with <i>Adonis</i>,
<i>Alcestis</i>, <i>Centauri</i>, <i>Helena</i>, <i>Ino</i>, <i>Protesilaudamia</i>, <i>Sirenocirca</i>,
<i>Phoenix</i>, which may, however, be only the parts of the <i>Erotopaegnia</i>.
They were not serious poems, but light and often
licentious skits on the heroic myths.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA FARGE, JOHN<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (1835-1910), American artist, was born
in New York, on the 31st of March 1835, of French parentage.
He received instruction in drawing from his grandfather,
Binsse de St Victor, a painter of miniatures; studied law and
architecture; entered the atelier of Thomas Couture in Paris,
where he remained a short time, giving especial attention to the
study and copying of old masters at the Louvre; and began
by making illustrations to the poets (1859). An intimacy with
the artist William M. Hunt had a strong influence on him,
the two working together at Newport, Rhode Island. La Farge
painted landscape, still life and figure alike in the early sixties.
But from 1866 on he was for some time incapacitated for work,
and when he regained strength he did some decorative work
for Trinity church, Boston, in 1876, and turned his attention
to stained glass, becoming president of the Society of Mural
Painters. Some of his important commissions include windows
for St Thomas&rsquo;s church (1877), St Peter&rsquo;s church, the Paulist
church, the Brick church (1882), the churches of the Incarnation
(1885) and the Ascension (1887), New York; Trinity church,
Buffalo, and the &ldquo;Battle Window&rdquo; in Memorial Hall at
Harvard; ceilings and windows for the house of Cornelius
Vanderbilt, windows for the houses of W. H. Vanderbilt
and D. O. Mills, and panels for the house of Whitelaw Reid,
New York; panels for the Congressional Library, Washington;
Bowdoin College, the Capitol at St Paul, Minn., besides designs
for many stained glass windows. He was also a prolific painter
in oil and water colour, the latter seen notably in some water-colour
sketches, the result of a voyage in the South Seas, shown
in 1895. His influence on American art was powerfully exhibited
in such men as Augustus St Gaudens, Wilton Lockwood, Francis
Lathrop and John Humphreys Johnston. He became president
of the Society of American Artists, a member of the National
Academy of Design in 1869; an officer of the Legion of Honour
of France; and received many medals and decorations. He
published <i>Considerations on Painting</i> (New York, 1895),
<i>Hok&#365;sai: A Talk about <span class="correction" title="amended from Hoksuai">Hok&#365;sai</span></i> (New York, 1897), and <i>An

<p><span class="bold">LA FARINA, GIUSEPPE<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> (1815-1863), Italian author and
politician, was born at Messina. On account of the part he took
in the insurrection of 1837 he had to leave Sicily, but returning
in 1839 he conducted various newspapers of liberal tendencies,
until his efforts were completely interdicted, when he removed
to Florence. In 1840 he had published <i>Messina ed i suoi monumenti</i>,
and after his removal to Florence he brought out <i>La
Germania coi suoi monumenti</i> (1842), <i>L&rsquo; Italia coi suoi monumenti</i>
(1842), <i>La Svizzera storica ed artistica</i> (1842-1843),
La China, 4 vols. (1843-1847), and <i>Storia d&rsquo; Italia</i>, 7 vols.
(1846-1854). In 1847 he established at Florence a democratic
journal, <i>L&rsquo; Alba</i>, in the interests of Italian freedom and unity,
but on the outbreak of the revolution in Sicily in 1848 he returned
thither and was elected deputy and member of the committee
of war. In August of that year he was appointed minister of
public instruction and later of war and marine. After vigorously
conducting a campaign against the Bourbon troops, he was
forced into exile, and repaired to France in 1849. In 1850 he
published his <i>Storia documentata della Rivoluzione Siciliana
del 1848-1849</i>, and in 1851-1852 his <i>Storia d&rsquo; Italia dal 1815
al 1848</i>, in 6 vols. He returned to Italy in 1854 and settled at
Turin, and in 1856 he founded the <i>Piccolo Corriere d&rsquo; Italia</i>, an
organ which had great influence in propagating the political
sentiments of the Società Nazionale Italiana, of which he ultimately
was chosen president. With Daniele Manin (<i>q.v.</i>), one
of the founders of that society, he advocated the unity of Italy
under Victor Emmanuel even before Cavour, with whom at
one time he had daily interviews, and organized the emigration
of volunteers from all parts of Italy into the Piedmontese army.
He also negotiated an interview between Cavour and Garibaldi,
with the result that the latter was appointed commander of
the Cacciatori delle Alpi in the war of 1859. Later he supported
Garibaldi&rsquo;s expedition to Sicily, where he himself went soon
after the occupation of Palermo, but he failed to bring about
the immediate annexation of the island to Piedmont as Cavour
wished. In 1860 he was chosen a member of the first Italian
parliament and was subsequently made councillor of state.
He died on the 5th of September 1863.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA FAYETTE, GILBERT MOTIER DE<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (1380-1462), marshal
of France, was brought up at the court of Louis II., 3rd duke
of Bourbon. He served under Marshal Boucicaut in Italy, and
on his return to France after the evacuation of Genoa in 1409
became seneschal of the Bourbonnais. In the English wars he
was with John I., 4th duke of Bourbon, at the capture of Soubise
in 1413, and of Compiègne in 1415. The duke then made him
lieutenant-general in Languedoc and Guienne. He failed to
defend Caen and Falaise in the interest of the dauphin (afterwards
Charles VII.) against Henry V. in 1417 and 1418, but in
the latter year he held Lyons for some time against Jean sans
Peur, duke of Burgundy. A series of successes over the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
and Burgundians on the Loire was rewarded in 1420 with the
government of Dauphiny and the office of marshal of France.
La Fayette commanded the Franco-Scottish troops at the battle
of Baugé (1422), though he did not, as has been sometimes stated,
slay Thomas, duke of Clarence, with his own hand. In 1424
he was taken prisoner by the English at Verneuil, but was
released shortly afterwards, and fought with Joan of Arc at
Orleans and Patay in 1429. The marshal had become a member
of the grand council of Charles VII., and with the exception of a
short disgrace about 1430, due to the ill-will of Georges de la
Trémouille, he retained the royal favour all his life. He took
an active part in the army reform initiated by Charles VII., and
the establishment of military posts for the suppression of brigandage.
His last campaign was against the English in Normandy
in 1449. He died on the 23rd of February 1462. His line was
continued by Gilbert IV. de La Fayette, son of his second
marriage with Jeanne de Joyeuse.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA FAYETTE, LOUISE DE<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1616-1665), was one of the
fourteen children of John, comte de La Fayette, and Marguerite
de Bourbon-Busset. Louise became maid of honour to Anne of
Austria, and Richelieu sought to attract the attention of Louis
XIII. to her in the hope that she might counterbalance the
influence exercised over him by Marie de Hautefort. The affair
did not turn out as the minister wished. The king did indeed
make her the confidante of his affairs and of his resentment
against the cardinal, but she, far from repeating his confidences
to the minister, set herself to encourage the king in his resistance
to Richelieu&rsquo;s dominion. She refused, nevertheless, to become
Louis&rsquo;s mistress, and after taking leave of the king in Anne of
Austria&rsquo;s presence retired to the convent of the Filles de Sainte-Marie
in 1637. Here she was repeatedly visited by Louis, with
whom she maintained a correspondence. Richelieu intercepted
the letters, and by omissions and falsifications succeeded in
destroying their mutual confidence. The cessation of their
intercourse was regretted by the queen, who had been reconciled
with her husband through the influence of Louise. At the time
of her death in January 1665 Mlle de La Fayette was superior
of a convent of her order which she had founded at Chaillot.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA FAYETTE, MARIE JOSEPH PAUL YVES ROCH GILBERT DU MOTIER.<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span>
<span class="sc">Marquis de</span> (1757-1834), was born at the château
of Chavaniac in Auvergne, France, on the 6th of September 1757.
His father<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> was killed at Minden in 1759, and his mother and his
grandfather died in 1770, and thus at the age of thirteen he was
left an orphan with a princely fortune. He married at sixteen
Marie Adrienne Françoise de Noailles (d. 1807), daughter of the
duc d&rsquo;Ayen and granddaughter of the duc de Noailles, then one
of the most influential families in the kingdom. La Fayette
chose to follow the career of his father, and entered the Guards.</p>

<p>La Fayette was nineteen and a captain of dragoons when the
English colonies in America proclaimed their independence.
&ldquo;At the first news of this quarrel,&rdquo; he afterwards wrote in his
memoirs, &ldquo;my heart was enrolled in it.&rdquo; The count de Broglie,
whom he consulted, discouraged his zeal for the cause of liberty.
Finding his purpose unchangeable, however, he presented the
young enthusiast to Johann Kalb, who was also seeking service
in America, and through Silas Deane, American agent in Paris,
an arrangement was concluded, on the 7th of December 1776,
by which La Fayette was to enter the American service as major-general.
At this moment the news arrived of grave disasters to
the American arms. La Fayette&rsquo;s friends again advised him to
abandon his purpose. Even the American envoys, Franklin
and Arthur Lee, who had superseded Deane, withheld further
encouragement and the king himself forbade his leaving. At
the instance of the British ambassador at Versailles orders were
issued to seize the ship La Fayette was fitting out at Bordeaux,
and La Fayette himself was arrested. But the ship was sent
from Bordeaux to a neighbouring port in Spain, La Fayette
escaped from custody in disguise, and before a second <i>lettre
de cachet</i> could reach him he was afloat with eleven chosen
companions. Though two British cruisers had been sent in
pursuit of him, he landed safely near Georgetown, S.C., after
a tedious voyage of nearly two months, and hastened to Philadelphia,
then the seat of government of the colonies.</p>

<p>When this lad of nineteen, with the command of only what
little English he had been able to pick up on his voyage, presented
himself to Congress with Deane&rsquo;s authority to demand a
commission of the highest rank after the commander-in-chief,
his reception was a little chilly. Deane&rsquo;s contracts were so
numerous, and for officers of such high rank, that it was impossible
for Congress to ratify them without injustice to Americans who
had become entitled by their service to promotion. La Fayette
appreciated the situation as soon as it was explained to him,
and immediately expressed his desire to serve in the American
army upon two conditions&mdash;that he should receive no pay, and
that he should act as a volunteer. These terms were so different
from those made by other foreigners, they had been attended
with such substantial sacrifices, and they promised such important
indirect advantages, that Congress passed a resolution, on
the 31st of July 1777, &ldquo;that his services be accepted, and that,
in consideration of his zeal, illustrious family and connexions,
he have the rank and commission of major-general of the United
States.&rdquo; Next day La Fayette met Washington, whose lifelong
friend he became. Congress intended his appointment as purely
honorary, and the question of giving him a command was left
entirely to Washington&rsquo;s discretion. His first battle was Brandywine
(<i>q.v.</i>) on the 11th of September 1777, where he showed
courage and activity and received a wound. Shortly afterwards
he secured what he most desired, the command of a division&mdash;the
immediate result of a communication from Washington to
Congress of November 1, 1777, in which he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The marquis de La Fayette is extremely solicitous of having a
command equal to his rank. I do not know in what light Congress
will view the matter, but it appears to me, from a consideration of
his illustrious and important connexions, the attachment which he
has manifested for our cause, and the consequences which his return
in disgust might produce, that it will be advisable to gratify his
wishes, and the more so as several gentlemen from France who
came over under some assurances have gone back disappointed in
their expectations. His conduct with respect to them stands in a
favourable point of view&mdash;having interested himself to remove their
uneasiness and urged the impropriety of their making any unfavourable
representations upon their arrival at home. Besides, he is
sensible, discreet in his manners, has made great proficiency in our
language, and from the disposition he discovered at the battle of
Brandywine possesses a large share of bravery and military ardour.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Of La Fayette&rsquo;s military career in the United States there
is not much to be said. Though the commander of a division,
he never had many troops in his charge, and whatever military
talents he possessed were not of the kind which appeared to
conspicuous advantage on the theatre to which his wealth and
family influence rather than his soldierly gifts had called him.
In the first months of 1778 he commanded troops detailed
for the projected expedition against Canada. His retreat from
Barren Hill (May 28, 1778) was commended as masterly; and
he fought at the battle of Monmouth (June 28,) and received
from Congress a formal recognition of his services in the Rhode
Island expedition (August 1778).</p>

<p>The treaties of commerce and defensive alliance, signed by the
insurgents and France on the 6th of February 1778, were promptly
followed by a declaration of war by England against the latter,
and La Fayette asked leave to revisit France and to consult his
king as to the further direction of his services. This leave was
readily granted; it was not difficult for Washington to replace
the major-general, but it was impossible to find another equally
competent, influential and devoted champion of the American
cause near the court of Louis XVI. In fact, he went on a mission
rather than a visit. He embarked on the 11th of January 1779,
was received with enthusiasm, and was made a colonel in the
French cavalry. On the 4th of March following Franklin wrote
to the president of Congress: &ldquo;The marquis de La Fayette ...
is infinitely esteemed and beloved here, and I am persuaded will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
do everything in his power to merit a continuance of the same
affection from America.&rdquo; He won the confidence of Vergennes.</p>

<p>La Fayette was absent from America about six months, and
his return was the occasion of a complimentary resolution of
Congress. From April until October 1781 he was charged with
the defence of Virginia, in which Washington gave him the
credit of doing all that was possible with the forces at his disposal;
and he showed his zeal by borrowing money on his own account
to provide his soldiers with necessaries. The battle of Yorktown,
in which La Fayette bore an honourable if not a distinguished
part, was the last of the war, and terminated his military career
in the United States. He immediately obtained leave to return
to France, where it was supposed he might be useful in negotiations
for a general peace. He was also occupied in the preparations
for a combined French and Spanish expedition against some of
the British West India Islands, of which he had been appointed
chief of staff, and a formidable fleet assembled at Cadiz, but
the armistice signed on the 20th of January 1783 between the
belligerents put a stop to the expedition. He had been promoted
(1781) to the rank of <i>maréchal de camp</i> (major-general)
in the French army, and he received every token of regard
from his sovereign and his countrymen. He visited the United
States again in 1784, and remained some five months as the
guest of the nation.</p>

<p>La Fayette did not appear again prominently in public life
until 1787, though he did good service to the French Protestants,
and became actively interested in plans to abolish slavery. In
1787 he took his seat in the Assembly of Notables. He
demanded, and he alone signed the demand, that the king
convoke the states-general, thus becoming a leader in the
French Revolution. He showed Liberal tendencies both in
that assembly and after its dispersal, and in 1788 was deprived,
in consequence, of his active command. In 1789 La
Fayette was elected to the states-general, and took a prominent
part in its proceedings. He was chosen vice-president of the
National Assembly, and on the 11th of July 1789 presented a
declaration of rights, modelled on Jefferson&rsquo;s Declaration of
Independence in 1776. On the 15th of July, the second day of
the new régime, La Fayette was chosen by acclamation colonel-general
of the new National Guard of Paris. He also proposed
the combination of the colours of Paris, red and blue, and the
royal white, into the famous tricolour cockade of modern France
(July 17). For the succeeding three years, until the end of the
constitutional monarchy in 1792, his history is largely the history
of France. His life was beset with very great responsibility
and perils, for he was ever the minister of humanity and order
among a frenzied people who had come to regard order and
humanity as phases of treason. He rescued the queen from the
hands of the populace on the 5th and 6th of October 1789,
saved many humbler victims who had been condemned to death,
and he risked his life in many unsuccessful attempts to rescue
others. Before this, disgusted with enormities which he was
powerless to prevent, he had resigned his commission; but so
impossible was it to replace him that he was induced to resume
it. In the Constituent Assembly he pleaded for the abolition of
arbitrary imprisonment, for religious tolerance, for popular
representation, for the establishment of trial by jury, for the
gradual emancipation of slaves, for the freedom of the press,
for the abolition of titles of nobility, and the suppression of
privileged orders. In February 1790 he refused the supreme
command of the National Guard of the kingdom. In May he
founded the &ldquo;Society of 1789&rdquo; which afterwards became the
Feuillants Club. He took a prominent part in the celebration
of July 14, 1790, the first anniversary of the destruction of the
Bastille. After suppressing an <i>émeute</i> in April 1791 he again
resigned his commission, and was again compelled to retain it.
He was the friend of liberty as well as of order, and when Louis
XVI. fled to Varennes he issued orders to stop him. Shortly
afterwards he was made lieutenant-general in the army. He
commanded the troops in the suppression of another <i>émeute</i>,
on the occasion of the proclamation of the constitution
(September 18, 1791), after which, feeling that his task
was done, he retired into private life. This did not prevent
his friends from proposing him for the mayoralty of Paris in
opposition to Pétion.</p>

<p>When, in December 1791, three armies were formed on the
western frontier to attack Austria, La Fayette was placed in
command of one of them. But events moved faster than La
Fayette&rsquo;s moderate and humane republicanism, and seeing that
the lives of the king and queen were each day more and more
in danger, he definitely opposed himself to the further advance
of the Jacobin party, intending eventually to use his army for
the restoration of a limited monarchy. On the 19th of August
1792 the Assembly declared him a traitor. He was compelled
to take refuge in the neutral territory of Liége, whence as one
of the prime movers in the Revolution he was taken and held
as a prisoner of state for five years, first in Prussian and
afterwards in Austrian prisons, in spite of the intercession of
America and the pleadings of his wife. Napoleon, however,
though he had a low opinion of his capacities, stipulated in the
treaty of Campo Formio (1797) for La Fayette&rsquo;s release. He
was not allowed to return to France by the Directory. He
returned in 1799; in 1802 voted against the life consulate of
Napoleon; and in 1804 he voted against the imperial title.
He lived in retirement during the First Empire, but returned
to public affairs under the First Restoration and took some
part in the political events of the Hundred Days. From 1818
to 1824 he was deputy for the Sarthe, speaking and voting
always on the Liberal side, and even becoming a <i>carbonaro</i>.
He then revisited America (July 1824-September 1825) where
he was overwhelmed with popular applause and voted the sum
of $200,000 and a township of land. From 1825 to his death he
sat in the Chamber of Deputies for Meaux. During the revolution
of 1830 he again took command of the National Guard and
pursued the same line of conduct, with equal want of success,
as in the first revolution. In 1834 he made his last speech&mdash;on
behalf of Polish political refugees. He died at Paris on the
20th of May 1834. In 1876 in the city of New York a monument
was erected to him, and in 1883 another was erected at Puy.</p>

<p>Few men have owed more of their success and usefulness
to their family rank than La Fayette, and still fewer have abused
it less. He never achieved distinction in the field, and his
political career proved him to be incapable of ruling a great
national movement; but he had strong convictions which
always impelled him to study the interests of humanity, and a
pertinacity in maintaining them, which, in all the strange vicissitudes
of his eventful life, secured him a very unusual measure of
public respect. No citizen of a foreign country has ever had so
many and such warm admirers in America, nor does any statesman
in France appear to have ever possessed uninterruptedly
for so many years so large a measure of popular influence and
respect. He had what Jefferson called a &ldquo;canine appetite&rdquo;
for popularity and fame, but in him the appetite only seemed to
make him more anxious to merit the fame which he enjoyed.
He was brave to rashness; and he never shrank from danger
or responsibility if he saw the way open to spare life or suffering,
to protect the defenceless, to sustain the law and preserve order.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Georges Washington Motier de La Fayette</span>
(1779-1849), entered the army and was aide-de-camp to General
Grouchy through the Austrian, Prussian and Polish (1805-07)
campaigns. Napoleon&rsquo;s distrust of his father rendering promotion
improbable, Georges de La Fayette retired into private life
in 1807 until the Restoration, when he entered the Chamber of
Representatives and voted consistently on the Liberal side.
He was away from Paris during the revolution of July 1830,
but he took an active part in the &ldquo;campaign of the banquets,&rdquo;
which led up to that of 1848. He died in December of the next
year. His son, <span class="sc">Oscar Thomas Gilbert Motier de La Fayette</span>
(1815-1881), was educated at the École Polytechnique, and
served as an artillery officer in Algeria. He entered the Chamber
of Representatives in 1846 and voted, like his father, with the
extreme Left. After the revolution of 1848 he received a post
in the provisional government, and as a member of the Constituent
Assembly he became secretary of the war committee.
After the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly in 1851, he
retired from public life, but emerged on the establishment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
the third republic, becoming a life senator in 1875. His brother
<span class="sc">Edmond Motier de La Fayette</span> (1818-1890) shared his political
opinions. He was one of the secretaries of the Constituent
Assembly, and a member of the senate from 1876 to 1888.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA FAYETTE, MARIE-MADELEINE PIOCHE DE LA VERGNE<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span>,
<span class="sc">Comtesse de</span> (1634-1692), French novelist, was
baptized in Paris, on the 18th of March 1634. Her father, Marc
Pioche de la Vergne, commandant of Havre, died when she was
sixteen, and her mother seems to have been more occupied with
her own than her daughter&rsquo;s interests. Mme de la Vergne
married in 1651 the chevalier de Sévigné, and Marie thus became
connected with Mme de Sévigné, who was destined to be a
lifelong friend. She studied Greek, Latin and Italian, and inspired
in one of her tutors, Gilles de Ménage, an enthusiastic
admiration which he expressed in verse in three or four languages.
Marie married in 1655 François Motier, comte de La Fayette.
They lived on the count&rsquo;s estates in Auvergne, according to her
own account (in a letter to Ménage) quite happily; but after
the birth of her two sons her husband disappeared so effectually
that it was long supposed that he died about 1660, though
he really lived until 1683. Mme de La Fayette had returned
to Paris, and about 1665 contracted an intimacy with the duc
de la Rochefoucauld, then engaged on his <i>Maximes</i>. The constancy
and affection that marked this liaison on both sides
justified it in the eyes of society, and when in 1680 La Rochefoucauld
died Mme de La Fayette received the sincerest sympathy.
Her first novel, <i>La Princesse de Montpensier</i>, was published
anonymously in 1662; <i>Zayde</i> appeared in 1670 under the name
of J. R. de Segrais; and in 1678 her masterpiece, <i>La Princesse
de Clèves</i>, also under the name of Segrais. The history of the
modern novel of sentiment begins with the <i>Princesse de Clèves</i>.
The interminable pages of Mlle de Scudéry with the <i>Précieuses</i>
and their admirers masquerading as Persians or ancient Romans
had already been discredited by the burlesques of Paul Scarron
and Antoine Furetière. It remained for Mme de La Fayette
to achieve the more difficult task of substituting something
more satisfactory than the disconnected episodes of the <i>roman
comique</i>. This she accomplished in a story offering in its shortness
and simplicity a complete contrast to the extravagant
and lengthy romances of the time. The interest of the story
depends not on incident but on the characters of the personages.
They act in a perfectly reasonable way and their motives are
analysed with the finest discrimination. No doubt the semi-autobiographical
character of the material partially explains
Mme de La Fayette&rsquo;s refusal to acknowledge the book. Contemporary
critics, even Mme de Sévigné amongst them, found
fault with the avowal made by Mme de Clèves to her husband.
In answer to these criticisms, which her anonymity prevented
her from answering directly, Mme de La Fayette wrote her
last novel, the <i>Comtesse de Tende</i>.</p>

<p>The character of her work and her history have combined
to give an impression of melancholy and sweetness that only
represents one side of her character, for a correspondence
brought to light comparatively recently showed her as the acute
diplomatic agent of Jeanne de Nemours, duchess of Savoy, at
the court of Louis XIV. She had from her early days also been
intimate with Henrietta of England, duchess of Orleans, under
whose immediate direction she wrote her <i>Histoire de Madame
Henriette d&rsquo;Angleterre</i>, which only appeared in 1720. She wrote
memoirs of the reign of Louis XIV., which, with the exception
of two chapters, for the years 1688 and 1689 (published at
Amsterdam, 1731), were lost through her son&rsquo;s carelessness.
Madame de La Fayette died on the 25th of May 1692.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAFAYETTE<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span>, a city and the county-seat of Tippecanoe
county, Indiana, U.S.A., situated at the former head of navigation
on the Wabash river, about 64 m. N.W. of Indianapolis.
Pop. (1900) 18,116, of whom 2266 were foreign-born; (1910
census) 20,081. It is served by the Chicago, Indianapolis
&amp; Louisville, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St Louis,
the Lake Erie &amp; Western, and the Wabash railways, and by
the Terre Haute, Indianapolis &amp; Eastern (electric), and the Fort
Wayne &amp; Wabash Valley (electric) railways. The river is not
now navigable at this point. Lafayette is in the valley of the
Wabash river, which is sunk below the normal level of the plain,
the surrounding heights being the walls of the Wabash basin.
The city has an excellent system of public schools, a good public
library, two hospitals, the Wabash Valley Sanitarium (Seventh
Day Adventist), St Anthony&rsquo;s Home for old people and two
orphan asylums. It is the seat of Purdue University, a co-educational,
technical and agricultural institution, opened in 1874
and named in honour of John Purdue (1802-1876), who gave
it $150,000. This university is under state control, and received
the proceeds of the Federal agricultural college grant of 1862
and of the second Morrill Act of 1890; in connexion with it
there is an agricultural experiment station. It had in 1908-1909
180 instructors, 1900 students, and a library of 25,000
volumes and pamphlets. Just outside the city is the State
Soldiers&rsquo; Home, where provision is also made for the wives and
widows of soldiers; in 1908 it contained 553 men and 700
women. The city lies in the heart of a rich agricultural region,
and is an important market for grain, produce and horses.
Among its manufactures are beer, foundry and machine shop
products (the Chicago, Indianapolis &amp; Louisville railway has
shops here), straw board, telephone apparatus, paper, wagons,
packed meats, canned goods, flour and carpets; the value of
the factory product increased from $3,514,276 in 1900 to
$4,631,415 in 1905, or 31.8%. The municipality owns its water
works.</p>

<p>Lafayette is about 5 m. N.E. of the site of the ancient Wea
(Miami) Indian village known as Ouiatanon, where the French
established a post about 1720. The French garrison gave way
to the English about 1760; the stockade fort was destroyed
during the conspiracy of Pontiac, and was never rebuilt. The
headquarters of Tecumseh and his brother, the &ldquo;Prophet,&rdquo;
were established 7 m. N. of Lafayette near the mouth of the
Tippecanoe river, and the settlement there was known as the
&ldquo;Prophet&rsquo;s Town.&rdquo; Near this place, and near the site of the
present village of Battle Ground (where the Indiana Methodists
now have a summer encampment and a camp meeting in August),
was fought on the 7th of November 1811 the battle of Tippecanoe,
in which the Indians were decisively defeated by Governor
William Henry Harrison, the whites losing 188 in killed and
wounded and the Indians about an equal number. The battle
ground is owned by the state; in 1907 the state legislature and
the United States Congress each appropriated $12,500 for a
monument, which took the form of a granite shaft 90 ft. high.
The first American settlers on the site of Lafayette appeared
about 1820, and the town was laid out in 1825, but for many
years its growth was slow. The completion of the Wabash and
Erie canal marked a new era in its development, and in 1854
Lafayette was incorporated.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA FERTÉ<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span>, the name of a number of localities in France,
differentiated by agnomens. La Ferté Imbault (department of
Loir-et-Cher) was in the possession of Jacques d&rsquo;Étampes
(1590-1668), marshal of France and ambassador in England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
who was known as the marquis of La Ferté Imbault. La
Ferté Nabert (the modern La Ferté Saint Aubin, department
of Loiret) was acquired in the 16th century by the house of Saint
Nectaire (corrupted to Senneterre), and erected into a duchy
in the peerage of France (<i>duché-pairie</i>) in 1665 for Henri de Saint
Nectaire, marshal of France. It was called La Ferté Lowendal
after it had been acquired by Marshal Lowendal in 1748.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA FERTÉ-BERNARD<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span>, a town of western France, in the
department of Sarthe, on the Huisne, 27 m. N.E. of Le Mans,
on the railway from Paris to that town. Pop. (1906) 4358.
La Ferté carries on cloth manufacture and flour-milling and
has trade in horses and cattle. Its church of Nôtre Dame has
a choir (16th century) with graceful apse-chapels of Renaissance
architecture and remarkable windows of the same period; the
remainder of the church is in the Flamboyant Gothic style.
The town hall occupies the superstructure and flanking towers
of a fortified gateway of the 15th century.</p>

<p>La Ferté-Bernard owes its origin and name to a stronghold
(<i>fermeté</i>) built about the 11th century and afterwards held by
the family of Bernard. In 1424 it did not succumb to the English
troops till after a four months&rsquo; siege. It belonged in the 16th
century to the family of Guise and supported the League, but
was captured by the royal forces in 1590.</p>

of Aisne on the Ourcq, 47 m. W. by S. of Reims by rail.
Pop. (1906) 1563. The town has imposing remains comprising
one side flanked by four towers of an unfinished castle built
about the beginning of the 15th century by Louis of Orleans,
brother of Charles VI. The churches of St Nicholas and Notre-Dame,
chiefly of the 16th century, both contain fine old stained
glass. Jean Racine, the poet, was born in the town, and a
statue by David d&rsquo;Augers has been erected to him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAFFITTE, JACQUES<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> (1767-1844), French banker and
politician, was born at Bayonne on the 24th of October 1767,
one of the ten children of a carpenter. He became clerk in
the banking house of Perregaux in Paris, was made a partner
in the business in 1800, and in 1804 succeeded Perregaux as
head of the firm. The house of Perregaux, Laffitte et Cie.
became one of the greatest in Europe, and Laffitte became
regent (1809), then governor (1814) of the Bank of France and
president of the Chamber of Commerce (1814). He raised large
sums of money for the provisional government in 1814 and for
Louis XVIII. during the Hundred Days, and it was with him
that Napoleon deposited five million francs in gold before
leaving France for the last time. Rather than permit the government
to appropriate the money from the Bank he supplied
two million from his own pocket for the arrears of the imperial
troops after Waterloo. He was returned by the department
of the Seine to the Chamber of Deputies in 1816, and took his seat
on the Left. He spoke chiefly on financial questions; his known
Liberal views did not prevent Louis XVIII. from insisting on
his inclusion on the commission on the public finances. In
1818 he saved Paris from a financial crisis by buying a large
amount of stock, but next year, in consequence of his heated
defence of the liberty of the press and the electoral law of 1867,
the governorship of the Bank was taken from him. One of the
earliest and most determined of the partisans of a constitutional
monarchy under the duke of Orleans, he was deputy for Bayonne
in July 1830, when his house in Paris became the headquarters
of the revolutionary party. When Charles X., after retracting
the hated ordinances, sent the comte d&rsquo;Argout<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> to Laffitte to
negotiate a change of ministry, the banker replied, &ldquo;It is too late.
There is no longer a Charles X.,&rdquo; and it was he who secured
the nomination of Louis Philippe as lieutenant-general of the
kingdom. On the 3rd of August he became president of the
Chamber of Deputies, and on the 9th he received in this capacity
Louis Philippe&rsquo;s oath to the new constitution. The clamour
of the Paris mob for the death of the imprisoned ministers of
Charles X., which in October culminated in riots, induced the
more moderate members of the government&mdash;including Guizot,
the duc de Broglie and Casimir-Périer&mdash;to hand over the
administration to a ministry which, possessing the confidence
of the revolutionary Parisians, should be in a better position
to save the ministers from their fury. On the 5th of November,
accordingly, Laffitte became minister-president of a government
pledged to progress (<i>mouvement</i>), holding at the same time the
portfolio of finance. The government was torn between the
necessity for preserving order and the no less pressing necessity
(for the moment) of conciliating the Parisian populace; with the
result that it succeeded in doing neither one nor the other.
The impeached ministers were, indeed, saved by the courage
of the Chamber of Peers and the attitude of the National Guard;
but their safety was bought at the price of Laffitte&rsquo;s popularity.
His policy of a French intervention in favour of the Italian
revolutionists, by which he might have regained his popularity,
was thwarted by the diplomatic policy of Louis Philippe. The
resignation of Lafayette and Dupont de l&rsquo;Eure still further
undermined the government, which, incapable even of keeping
order in the streets of Paris, ended by being discredited with all
parties. At length Louis Philippe, anxious to free himself
from the hampering control of the agents of his fortune, thought
it safe to parade his want of confidence in the man who had
made him king. Thereupon, in March 1831, Laffitte resigned,
begging pardon of God and man for the part he had played in
raising Louis Philippe to the throne. He left office politically
and financially a ruined man. His affairs were wound up in
1836, and next year he created a credit bank, which prospered
as long as he lived, but failed in 1848. He died in Paris on the
26th of May 1844.</p>

at Paris as a teacher of mathematics, he became a disciple of
Comte, who appointed him his literary executor. On the

The chief interest of the town lies in the Prytanée, a famous
school for the sons of officers, originally a college founded for
the Jesuits in 1607 by Henry IV. The buildings, including a
fine chapel, were erected from 1620 to 1653 and are surrounded
by a park. A bronze statue of Henry IV. stands in the marketplace.
La Flèche is the seat of a sub-prefect and of a tribunal
of first instance, and carries on tanning, flour-milling, and the
manufacture of paper, starch, wooden shoes and gloves. It is an

<p><span class="bold">LAFONT, PIERRE CHÉRI<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (1797-1873), French actor, was
born at Bordeaux on the 15th of May 1797. Abandoning his
profession as assistant ship&rsquo;s doctor in the navy, he went to
Paris to study singing and acting. He had some experience at
a small theatre, and was preparing to appear at the Opéra
Comique when the director of the Vaudeville offered him an
engagement. Here he made his <i>début</i> in 1821 in <i>La Somnambule</i>,
and his good looks and excellent voice soon brought him into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
public favour. After several years at the Nouveautés and the
Vaudeville, on the burning of the latter in 1838 he went to
England, and married, at Gretna Green, Jenny Colon, from
whom he was soon divorced. On his return to Paris he joined
the Variétés, where he acted for fifteen years in such plays as
<i>Le Chevalier de Saint Georges</i>, <i>Le Lion empaillé</i>, <i>Une dernière
conquête</i>, &amp;c. Another engagement at the Vaudeville followed,
and one at the Gaiété, and he ended his brilliant career at the
Gymnase in the part of the noble father in such plays as Les
<i>Vieux Garçons</i> and <i>Nos bons villageois</i>. He died in Paris on the

<p><span class="bold">LA FONTAINE, JEAN DE<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (1621-1695), French poet, was
born at Château Thierry in Champagne, probably on the 8th of
July 1621. His father was Charles de La Fontaine, &ldquo;maître
des eaux et forêts&rdquo;&mdash;a kind of deputy-ranger&mdash;of the duchy of
Château Thierry; his mother was Françoise Pidoux. On
both sides his family was of the highest provincial middle
class, but was not noble; his father was also fairly wealthy.
Jean, the eldest child, was educated at the <i>collège</i> (grammar-school)
of Reims, and at the end of his school days he entered
the Oratory in May 1641, and the seminary of Saint-Magloire
in October of the same year; but a very short sojourn proved
to him that he had mistaken his vocation. He then apparently
studied law, and is said to have been admitted as <i>avocat</i>, though
there does not seem to be actual proof of this. He was, however,
settled in life, or at least might have been so, somewhat early.
In 1647 his father resigned his rangership in his favour, and
arranged a marriage for him with Marie Héricart, a girl of sixteen,
who brought him twenty thousand livres, and expectations.
She seems to have been both handsome and intelligent, but the
two did not get on well together. There appears to be absolutely
no ground for the vague scandal as to her conduct, which was,
for the most part long afterwards, raised by gossips or personal
enemies of La Fontaine. All that is positively said against
her is that she was a negligent housewife and an inveterate
novel reader; La Fontaine himself was constantly away from
home, was certainly not strict in point of conjugal fidelity, and
was so bad a man of business that his affairs became involved
in hopeless difficulty, and a <i>séparation de biens</i> had to take
place in 1658. This was a perfectly amicable transaction for
the benefit of the family; by degrees, however, the pair, still
without any actual quarrel, ceased to live together, and for the
greater part of the last forty years of La Fontaine&rsquo;s life he lived
in Paris while his wife dwelt at Château Thierry, which, however,
he frequently visited. One son was born to them in 1653, and
was educated and taken care of wholly by his mother.</p>

<p>Even in the earlier years of his marriage La Fontaine seems
to have been much at Paris, but it was not till about 1656 that
he became a regular visitor to the capital. The duties of his
office, which were only occasional, were compatible with this
non-residence. It was not till he was past thirty that his literary
career began. The reading of Malherbe, it is said, first awoke
poetical fancies in him, but for some time he attempted nothing
but trifles in the fashion of the time&mdash;epigrams, ballades, rondeaux,
&amp;c. His first serious work was a translation or adaptation of
the <i>Eunuchus of Terence</i> (1654). At this time the Maecenas
of French letters was the Superintendant Fouquet, to whom
La Fontaine was introduced by Jacques Jannart, a connexion
of his wife&rsquo;s. Few people who paid their court to Fouquet went
away empty-handed, and La Fontaine soon received a pension
of 1000 livres (1659), on the easy terms of a copy of verses for
each quarter&rsquo;s receipt. He began too a medley of prose and
poetry, entitled <i>Le Songe de Vaux</i>, on Fouquet&rsquo;s famous country
house. It was about this time that his wife&rsquo;s property had to
be separately secured to her, and he seems by degrees to have
had to sell everything of his own; but, as he never lacked
powerful and generous patrons, this was of small importance
to him. In the same year he wrote a ballad, <i>Les Rieurs du
Beau-Richard</i>, and this was followed by many small pieces of
occasional poetry addressed to various personages from the king
downwards. Fouquet soon incurred the royal displeasure, but
La Fontaine, like most of his literary protégés, was not unfaithful
to him, the well-known elegy <i>Pleurez, nymphes de Vaux</i>, being
by no means the only proof of his devotion. Indeed it is thought
not improbable that a journey to Limoges in 1663 in company
with Jannart, and of which we have an account written to his
wife, was not wholly spontaneous, as it certainly was not on
Jannart&rsquo;s part. Just at this time his affairs did not look promising.
His father and himself had assumed the title of esquire,
to which they were not strictly entitled, and, some old edicts
on the subject having been put in force, an informer procured a
sentence against the poet fining him 2000 livres. He found,
however, a new protector in the duke and still more in the
duchess of Bouillon, his feudal superiors at Château Thierry,
and nothing more is heard of the fine. Some of La Fontaine&rsquo;s
liveliest verses are addressed to the duchess, Anne Mancini,
the youngest of Mazarin&rsquo;s nieces, and it is even probable that
the taste of the duke and duchess for Ariosto had something
to do with the writing of his first work of real importance, the
first book of the <i>Contes</i>, which appeared in 1664. He was then
forty-three years old, and his previous printed productions
had been comparatively trivial, though much of his work was
handed about in manuscript long before it was regularly published.
It was about this time that the quartette of the Rue du Vieux
Colombier, so famous in French literary history, was formed.
It consisted of La Fontaine, Racine, Boileau and Molière, the
last of whom was almost of the same age as La Fontaine, the
other two considerably younger. Chapelle was also a kind of
outsider in the coterie. There are many anecdotes, some pretty
obviously apocryphal, about these meetings. The most characteristic
is perhaps that which asserts that a copy of Chapelain&rsquo;s
unlucky <i>Pucelle</i> always lay on the table, a certain number of
lines of which was the appointed punishment for offences against
the company. The coterie furnished under feigned names
the personages of La Fontaine&rsquo;s version of the Cupid and Psyche
story, which, however, with <i>Adonis</i>, was not printed till 1669.
Meanwhile the poet continued to find friends. In 1664 he was
regularly commissioned and sworn in as gentleman to the
duchess dowager of Orleans, and was installed in the Luxembourg.
He still retained his rangership, and in 1666 we have something
like a reprimand from Colbert suggesting that he should look
into some malpractices at Château Thierry. In the same year
appeared the second book of the <i>Contes</i>, and in 1668 the first
six books of the <i>Fables</i>, with more of both kinds in 1671. In
this latter year a curious instance of the docility with which the
poet lent himself to any influence was afforded by his officiating,
at the instance of the Port-Royalists, as editor of a volume of
sacred poetry dedicated to the prince de Conti. A year afterwards
his situation, which had for some time been decidedly
flourishing, showed signs of changing very much for the worse.
The duchess of Orleans died, and he apparently had to give up
his rangership, probably selling it to pay debts. But there was
always a providence for La Fontaine. Madame de la Sablière,
a woman of great beauty, of considerable intellectual power
and of high character, invited him to make his home in her house,
where he lived for some twenty years. He seems to have had
no trouble whatever about his affairs thenceforward; and could
devote himself to his two different lines of poetry, as well as to
that of theatrical composition.</p>

<p>In 1682 he was, at more than sixty years of age, recognized
as one of the first men of letters of France. Madame de Sévigné,
one of the soundest literary critics of the time, and by no means
given to praise mere novelties, had spoken of his second collection
of <i>Fables</i> published in the winter of 1678 as divine; and it is
pretty certain that this was the general opinion. It was not
unreasonable, therefore, that he should present himself to the
Academy, and, though the subjects of his <i>Contes</i> were scarcely
calculated to propitiate that decorous assembly, while his
attachment to Fouquet and to more than one representative
of the old Frondeur party made him suspect to Colbert and the
king, most of the members were his personal friends. He was
first proposed in 1682, but was rejected for Dangeau. The next
year Colbert died and La Fontaine was again nominated. Boileau
was also a candidate, but the first ballot gave the fabulist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
sixteen votes against seven only for the critic. The king, whose
assent was necessary, not merely for election but for a second
ballot in case of the failure of an absolute majority, was ill-pleased,
and the election was left pending. Another vacancy occurred,
however, some months later, and to this Boileau was elected.
The king hastened to approve the choice effusively, adding,
&ldquo;Vous pouvez incessamment recevoir La Fontaine, il a promis
d&rsquo;être sage.&rdquo; His admission was indirectly the cause of the
only serious literary quarrel of his life. A dispute took place
between the Academy and one of its members, Antoine Furetière,
on the subject of the latter&rsquo;s French dictionary, which was
decided to be a breach of the Academy&rsquo;s corporate privileges.
Furetière, a man of no small ability, bitterly assailed those whom
he considered to be his enemies, and among them La Fontaine,
whose unlucky <i>Contes</i> made him peculiarly vulnerable, his
second collection of these tales having been the subject of a
police condemnation. The death of the author of the <i>Roman
Bourgeois</i>, however, put an end to this quarrel. Shortly afterwards
La Fontaine had a share in a still more famous affair,
the celebrated Ancient-and-Modern squabble in which Boileau
and Perrault were the chiefs, and in which La Fontaine (though
he had been specially singled out by Perrault for favourable
comparison with Aesop and Phaedrus) took the Ancient side.
About the same time (1685-1687) he made the acquaintance
of the last of his many hosts and protectors, Monsieur and
Madame d&rsquo;Hervart, and fell in love with a certain Madame
Ulrich, a lady of some position but of doubtful character. This
acquaintance was accompanied by a great familiarity with
Vendôme, Chaulieu and the rest of the libertine coterie of the
Temple; but, though Madame de la Sablière had long given
herself up almost entirely to good works and religious exercises,
La Fontaine continued an inmate of her house until her death
in 1693. What followed is told in one of the best known of
the many stories bearing on his childlike nature. Hervart on
hearing of the death, had set out at once to find La Fontaine.
He met him in the street in great sorrow, and begged him to make
his home at his house. &ldquo;J&rsquo;y allais&rdquo; was La Fontaine&rsquo;s answer.
He had already undergone the process of conversion during
a severe illness the year before. An energetic young priest,
M. Poucet, had brought him, not indeed to understand, but to
acknowledge the impropriety of the <i>Contes</i>, and it is said that
the destruction of a new play of some merit was demanded and
submitted to as a proof of repentance. A pleasant story is told
of the young duke of Burgundy, Fénelon&rsquo;s pupil, who was then
only eleven years old, sending 50 louis to La Fontaine as a
present of his own motion. But, though La Fontaine recovered
for the time, he was broken by age and infirmity, and his new
hosts had to nurse rather than to entertain him, which they
did very carefully and kindly. He did a little more work, completing
his <i>Fables</i> among other things; but he did not survive
Madame de la Sablière much more than two years, dying on the
13th of April 1695, at the age of seventy-three. He was buried
in the cemetery of the Holy Innocents. His wife survived him
nearly fifteen years.</p>

<p>The curious personal character of La Fontaine, like that of
some other men of letters, has been enshrined in a kind of legend
by literary tradition. At an early age his absence of mind and
indifference to business gave a subject to Tallemant des Réaux.
His later contemporaries helped to swell the tale, and the 18th
century finally accepted it, including the anecdotes of his meeting
his son, being told who he was, and remarking, &ldquo;Ah, yes, I
thought I had seen him somewhere!&rdquo; of his insisting on fighting
a duel with a supposed admirer of his wife, and then imploring
him to visit at his house just as before; of his going into company
with his stockings wrong side out, &amp;c., with, for a contrast,
those of his awkwardness and silence, if not positive rudeness,
in company. It ought to be remembered, as a comment on the
unfavourable description by La Bruyère, that La Fontaine was a
special friend and ally of Benserade, La Bruyère&rsquo;s chief literary
enemy. But after all deductions much will remain, especially
when it is remembered that one of the chief authorities for these
anecdotes is Louis Racine, a man who possessed intelligence
and moral worth, and who received them from his father, La
Fontaine&rsquo;s attached friend for more than thirty years. Perhaps
the best worth recording of all these stories is one of the Vieux
Colombier quartette, which tells how Molière, while Racine
and Boileau were exercising their wits upon &ldquo;le bonhomme&rdquo;
or &ldquo;le bon&rdquo; (by both which titles La Fontaine was familiarly
known), remarked to a bystander, &ldquo;Nos beaux esprits ont beau
faire, ils n&rsquo;effaceront pas le bonhomme.&rdquo; They have not.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The works of La Fontaine, the total bulk of which is considerable,
fall no less naturally than traditionally into three divisions, the
<i>Fables</i>, the <i>Contes</i> and the miscellaneous works. Of these the first
may be said to be known universally, the second to be known to
all lovers of French literature, the third to be with a few exceptions
practically forgotten. This distribution of the judgment of posterity
is as usual just in the main, but not wholly. There are excellent
things in the <i>&OElig;uvres Diverses</i>, but their excellence is only occasional,
and it is not at the best equal to that of the <i>Fables</i> or the <i>Contes</i>.
It was thought by contemporary judges who were both competent
and friendly that La Fontaine attempted too many styles, and there
is something in the criticism. His dramatic efforts are especially
weak. The best pieces usually published under his name&mdash;<i>Ragotin</i>,
<i>Le Florentin</i>, <i>La Coupe enchantée</i>, were originally fathered not by
him but by Champmeslé, the husband of the famous actress who
captivated Racine and Charles de Sévigné. His avowed work was
chiefly in the form of opera, a form of no great value at its best.
<i>Psyche</i> has all the advantages of its charming story and of La
Fontaine&rsquo;s style, but it is perhaps principally interesting nowadays
because of the framework of personal conversation already alluded to.
The mingled prose and verse of the <i>Songe de Vaux</i> is not uninteresting,
but its best things, such as the description of night&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;Laissant tomber les fleurs et ne les semant pas,&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">which has enchanted French critics, are little more than conceits,
though as in this case sometimes very beautiful conceits. The
elegies, the epistles, the epigrams, the ballades, contain many things
which would be very creditable to a minor poet or a writer of vers de
société, but even if they be taken according to the wise rule of modern
criticism, each in its kind, and judged simply according to their rank
in that kind, they fall far below the merits of the two great collections
of verse narratives which have assured La Fontaine&rsquo;s immortality.</p>

<p>Between the actual literary merits of the two there is not much
to choose, but the change of manners and the altered standard of
literary decency have thrown the <i>Contes</i> into the shade. These tales
are identical in general character with those which amused Europe
from the days of the early <i>fabliau</i> writers. Light love, the misfortunes
of husbands, the cunning of wives, the breach of their vows
by ecclesiastics, constitute the staple of their subject. In some
respects La Fontaine is the best of such tale-tellers, while he is
certainly the latest who deserves such excuse as may be claimed by
a writer who does not choose indecent subjects from a deliberate
knowledge that they are considered indecent, and with a deliberate
desire to pander to a vicious taste. No one who followed him in the
style can claim this excuse; he can, and the way in which contemporaries
of stainless virtue such as Madame de Sévigné speak of his work
shows that, though the new public opinion was growing up, it was not
finally accepted. In the <i>Contes</i> La Fontaine for the most part
attempts little originality of theme. He takes his stories (varying
them, it is true, in detail not a little) from Boccaccio, from Marguerite,
from the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>, &amp;c. He applies to them his
marvellous power of easy sparkling narration, and his hardly less
marvellous faculty of saying more or less outrageous things in the
most polite and gentlemanly manner. These <i>Contes</i> have indeed
certain drawbacks. They are not penetrated by the half pagan
ardour for physical beauty and the delights of sense which animates
and excuses the early Italian Renaissance. They have not the subtle
mixture of passion and sensuality, of poetry and appetite, which
distinguishes the work of Marguerite and of the Pléiade. They are
emphatically <i>contes pour rire</i>, a genuine expression of the <i>esprit
gaulois</i> of the fabliau writers and of Rabelais, destitute of the grossness
of envelope which had formerly covered that spirit. A comparison
of &ldquo;La Fiancée du roi de Garbe&rdquo; with its original in
Boccaccio (especially if the reader takes M. Émile Montégut&rsquo;s admirable
essay as a commentary) will illustrate better than anything
else what they have and what they have not. Some writers have
pleaded hard for the admission of actual passion of the poetical sort
in such pieces as &ldquo;La Courtisane amoureuse,&rdquo; but as a whole it
must be admitted to be absent.</p>

<p>The <i>Fables</i>, with hardly less animation and narrative art than the
<i>Contes</i>, are free from disadvantages (according to modern notions) of
subject, and exhibit the versatility and fecundity of the author&rsquo;s
talent perhaps even more fully. La Fontaine had many predecessors
in the fable and especially in the beast fable. In his first issue,
comprising what are now called the first six books, he adhered to the
path of these predecessors with some closeness; but in the later
collections he allowed himself far more liberty, and it is in these parts
that his genius is most fully manifested. The boldness of the politics
is as much to be considered as the ingenuity of the moralizing, as the
intimate knowledge of human nature displayed in the substance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
the narratives, or as the artistic mastery shown in their form. It has
sometimes been objected that the view of human character which La
Fontaine expresses is unduly dark, and resembles too much that of
La Rochefoucauld, for whom the poet certainly had a profound
admiration. The discussion of this point would lead us too far here.
It may only be said that satire (and La Fontaine is eminently a
satirist) necessarily concerns itself with the darker rather than with
the lighter shades. Indeed the objection has become pretty nearly
obsolete with the obsolescence of what may be called the
sentimental-ethicalschool of criticism. Its last overt expression was made by
Lamartine, excellently answered by Sainte-Beuve. Exception has
also been taken to the <i>Fables</i> on more purely literary, but hardly less
purely arbitrary grounds by Lessing. Perhaps the best criticism
ever passed upon La Fontaine&rsquo;s <i>Fables</i> is that of Silvestre de Sacy,
to the effect that they supply three several delights to three several
ages: the child rejoices in the freshness and vividness of the story,
the eager student of literature in the consummate art with which it is
told, the experienced man of the world in the subtle reflections on
character and life which it conveys. Nor has any one, with the exception
of a few paradoxers like Rousseau and a few sentimentalists
like Lamartine, denied that the moral tone of the whole is as fresh
and healthy as its literary interest is vivid. The book has therefore
naturally become the standard reading book of French both at
home and abroad, a position which it shares in verse with the
<i>Télémaque</i> of Fénelon in prose. It is no small testimony to its merit
that not even this use or misuse has interfered with its popularity.</p>

<p>The general literary character of La Fontaine is, with allowance
made for the difference of subject, visible equally in the <i>Fables</i> and in
the <i>Contes</i>. Perhaps one of the hardest sayings in French literature
for an English student is the dictum of Joubert to the effect that
&ldquo;<i>Il y a dans La Fontaine une plénitude de poésie qu&rsquo;on ne trouve nulle
part dans les autres auteurs français.</i>&rdquo; The difficulty arises from the
ambiguity of the terms. For inventiveness of fancy and for diligent
observation of the rules of art La Fontaine deserves, if not the first,
almost the first place among French poets. In his hands the oldest
story becomes novel, the most hackneyed moral piquant, the most
commonplace details fresh and appropriate. As to the second point
there has not been such unanimous agreement. It used to be considered
that La Fontaine&rsquo;s ceaseless diversity of metre, his archaisms,
his licences in rhyme and orthography, were merely ingenious devices
for the sake of easy writing, intended to evade the trammels of the
stately couplet and <i>rimes difficiles</i> enjoined by Boileau. Lamartine
in the attack already mentioned affects contempt of the &ldquo;vers
boiteux, disloqués, inégaux, sans symmétrie ni dans l&rsquo;oreille ni sur la
page.&rdquo; This opinion may be said to have been finally exploded by
the most accurate metrical critic and one of the most skilful metrical
practitioners that France has ever had, Théodore de Banville; and
it is only surprising that it should ever have been entertained by any
professional maker of verse. La Fontaine&rsquo;s irregularities are strictly
regulated, his cadences carefully arranged, and the whole effect may
be said to be (though, of course, in a light and tripping measure instead
of a stately one) similar to that of the stanzas of the English pindaric
ode in the hands of Dryden or Collins. There is therefore nothing
against La Fontaine on the score of invention and nothing on the
score of art. But something more, at least according to English
standards, is wanted to make up a &ldquo;plenitude of poesy,&rdquo; and this
something more La Fontaine seldom or never exhibits. In words
used by Joubert himself elsewhere, he never &ldquo;transports.&rdquo; The
faculty of transporting is possessed and used in very different manners
by different poets. In some it takes the form of passion, in some of
half mystical enthusiasm for nature, in some of commanding eloquence,
in some of moral fervour. La Fontaine has none of these
things: he is always amusing, always sensible, always clever, sometimes
even affecting, but at the same time always more or less prosaic,
were it not for his admirable versification. He is not a great poet,
perhaps not even a great humorist; but he is the most admirable
teller of light tales in verse that has ever existed in any time or
country; and he has established in his verse-tale a model which is
never likely to be surpassed.</p>

<p>La Fontaine did not during his life issue any complete edition of
his works, nor even of the two greatest and most important divisions
of them. The most remarkable of his separate publications have
already been noticed. Others were the <i>Poëme de la captivité de St
Malc</i> (1673), one of the pieces inspired by the Port-Royalists, the
<i>Poëme du Quinquina</i> (1692), a piece of task work also, though of a
very different kind, and a number of pieces published either in small
pamphlets or with the works of other men. Among the latter may
be singled out the pieces published by the poet with the works of
his friend Maucroix (1685). The year after his death some posthumous
works appeared, and some years after his son&rsquo;s death the
scattered poems, letters, &amp;c., with the addition of some unpublished
work bought from the family in manuscript, were carefully edited
and published as <i>&OElig;uvres diverses</i> (1729). During the 18th century
two of the most magnificent illustrated editions ever published of
any poet reproduced the two chief works of La Fontaine. The
<i>Fables</i> were illustrated by Oudry (1755-1759), the <i>Contes</i> by Eisen
(1762). This latter under the title of &ldquo;Edition des Fermiers-Généraux&rdquo;
fetches a high price. During the first thirty years of
the 19th century Walckenaer, a great student of French 17th-century
classics, published for the house of Didot three successive editions of
La Fontaine, the last (1826-1827) being perhaps entitled to the rank
of the standard edition, as his <i>Histoire de la vie et des ouvrages de La
Fontaine</i> is the standard biography and bibliography. The later
editions of M. Marty-Laveaux in the <i>Bibliothèque elzévirienne</i>, A.
Pauly in the <i>Collection des classiques françaises</i> of M. Lemerre and
L. Moland in that of M. Garnier supply in different forms all that can
be wished. The second is the handsomest, the third, which is complete,
perhaps the most generally useful. Editions, selections, translations,
&amp;c., of the <i>Fables</i>, especially for school use, are innumerable;
but an illustrated edition published by the <i>Librairie des Bibliophiles</i>
(1874) deserves to be mentioned as not unworthy of its 18th-century
predecessors. The works of M. Grouchy, <i>Documents inédits sur
La Fontaine</i> (1893); of G. Lafenestre, <i>Jean de La Fontaine</i> (1895);
and of Émile Faguet, <i>Jean de La Fontaine</i> (1900), should be
mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAFONTAINE, SIR LOUIS HIPPOLYTE<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span>, <span class="sc">Bart.</span> (1807-1864),
Canadian statesman and judge, third son of Antoine Ménard
LaFontaine (1772-1813) and Marie-J-Fontaine Bienvenue, was
born at Boucherville in the province of Quebec on the 4th of
October 1807. LaFontaine was educated at the Collège de
Montréal under the direction of the Sulpicians, and was called
to the bar of the province of Lower Canada on the 18th of August
1829. He married firstly Adèle, daughter of A. Berthelot of
Quebec; and, secondly, Jane, daughter of Charles Morrison,
of Berthier, by whom he had two sons. In 1830 he was elected
a member of the House of Assembly for the county of Terrebonne,
and became an ardent supporter of Louis Joseph Papineau in
opposing the administration of the governor-in-chief, which led
to the rebellion of 1837. LaFontaine, however, did not approve
the violent methods of his leader, and after the hostilities at
Saint Denis he presented a petition to Lord Gosford requesting
him to summon the assembly and to adopt measures to stem
the revolutionary course of events in Lower Canada. The
rebellion broke out afresh in the autumn of 1838; the constitution
of 1791 was suspended; LaFontaine was imprisoned for a
brief period; and Papineau, who favoured annexation by the
United States, was in exile. At this crisis in Lower Canada the
French Canadians turned to LaFontaine as their leader, and
under his direction maintained their opposition to the special
council, composed of nominees of the crown. In 1839 Lord
Sydenham, the governor-general, offered the solicitor generalship
to LaFontaine, which he refused; and after the Union of 1841
LaFontaine was defeated in the county of Terrebonne through
the governor&rsquo;s influence. During the next year he obtained a
seat in the assembly of the province of Canada, and on the death
of Sydenham he was called by Sir Charles Bagot to form an
administration with Robert Baldwin. The ministry resigned
in November 1843, as a protest against the actions of Lord
Metcalfe, who had succeeded Bagot. In 1848 LaFontaine
formed a new administration with Baldwin, and remained in
office until 1851, when he retired from public life. It was during
the ministry of LaFontaine-Baldwin that the Amnesty Bill
was passed, which occasioned grave riots in Montreal, personal
violence to Lord Elgin and the destruction of the parliament
buildings. After the death of Sir James Stuart in 1853 LaFontaine
was appointed chief justice of Lower Canada and
president of the seigneurial court, which settled the vexed
question of land tenure in Canada; and in 1854 he was created
a baronet. He died at Montreal on the 26th of February 1864.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>LaFontaine was well versed in constitutional history and French
law; he reasoned closely and presented his conclusions with directness.
He was upright in his conduct, sincerely attached to the traditions of
his race, and laboured conscientiously to establish responsible government
in Canada. His principal works are: <i>L&rsquo;Analyse de l&rsquo;ordonnance
du conseil spécial sur les bureaux d&rsquo;hypothèques</i> (Montreal, 1842);
<i>Observations sur les questions seigneuriales</i> (Montreal, 1854); see <i>LaFontaine</i>,

<p><span class="bold">LAFOSSE, CHARLES DE<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (1640-1716), French painter, was
born in Paris. He was one of the most noted and least servile
pupils of Le Brun, under whose direction he shared in the chief
of the great decorative works undertaken in the reign of Louis
XIV. Leaving France in 1662, he spent two years in Rome and
three in Venice, and the influence of his prolonged studies of
Veronese is evident in his &ldquo;Finding of Moses&rdquo; (Louvre), and
in his &ldquo;Rape of Proserpine&rdquo; (Louvre), which he presented
to the Royal Academy as his diploma picture in 1673. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
at once named assistant professor, and in 1674 the full responsibilities
of the office devolved on him, but his engagements did not
prevent his accepting in 1689 the invitation of Lord Montagu
to decorate Montagu House. He visited London twice, remaining
on the second occasion&mdash;together with Rousseau and Monnoyer&mdash;more
than two years. William III. vainly strove to detain
him in England by the proposal that he should decorate Hampton
Court, for Le Brun was dead, and Mansart pressed Lafosse to
return to Paris to take in hand the cupola of the Invalides.
The decorations of Montagu House are destroyed, those of
Versailles are restored, and the dome of the Invalides (engraved,
Picart and Cochin) is now the only work existing which gives
a full measure of his talent. During his latter years Lafosse
executed many other important decorations in public buildings
and private houses, notably in that of Crozat, under whose roof

<p><span class="bold">LAGARDE, PAUL ANTON DE<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> (1827-1891), German biblical
scholar and orientalist, was born at Berlin on the 2nd of
November 1827. His real name was Bötticher, Lagarde being
his mother&rsquo;s name. At Berlin (1844-1846) and Halle (1846-1847)
he studied theology, philosophy and oriental languages.
In 1852 his studies took him to London and Paris. In 1854 he
became a teacher at a Berlin public school, but this did not
interrupt his biblical studies. He edited the <i>Didascalia apostolorum
syriace</i> (1854), and other Syriac texts collected in the
British Museum and in Paris. In 1866 he received three years&rsquo;
leave of absence to collect fresh materials, and in 1869 succeeded
Heinrich Ewald as professor of oriental languages at Göttingen.
Like Ewald, Lagarde was an active worker in a variety of
subjects and languages; but his chief aim, the elucidation of
the Bible, was almost always kept in view. He edited the
Aramaic translation (known as the Targum) of the Prophets
according to the Codex Reuchlinianus preserved at Carlsruhe,
<i>Prophetae chaldaice</i> (1872), the <i>Hagiographa chaldaice</i> (1874),
an Arabic translation of the Gospels, <i>Die vier Evangelien, arabisch
aus der Wiener Handschrift herausgegeben</i> (1864), a Syriac
translation of the Old Testament Apocrypha, <i>Libri V. T.
apocryphi syriace</i> (1861), a Coptic translation of the Pentateuch,
<i>Der Pentateuch koptisch</i> (1867), and a part of the Lucianic text
of the Septuagint, which he was able to reconstruct from manuscripts
for nearly half the Old Testament. He devoted himself
ardently to oriental scholarship, and published <i>Zur Urgeschichte
der Armenier</i> (1854) and <i>Armenische Studien</i> (1877). He was
also a student of Persian, publishing <i>Isaias persice</i> (1883) and
<i>Persische Studien</i> (1884). He followed up his Coptic studies
with <i>Aegyptiaca</i> (1883), and published many minor contributions
to the study of oriental languages in <i>Gesammelte Abhandlungen</i>
(1866), <i>Symmicta</i> (i. 1877, ii. 1880), <i>Semitica</i> (i. 1878, ii. 1879),
<i>Orientalia</i> (1879-1880) and <i>Mittheilungen</i> (1884). Mention
should also be made of the valuable <i>Onomastica sacra</i> (1870;
2nd ed., 1887). Lagarde also took some part in politics. He
belonged to the Prussian Conservative party, and was a violent
anti-Semite. The bitterness which he felt appeared in his
writings. He died at Göttingen on the 22nd of December 1891.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAGASH<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Sirpurla</span>, one of the oldest centres of Sumerian
civilization in Babylonia. It is represented by a rather low,
long line of ruin mounds, along the dry bed of an ancient canal,
some 3 m. E. of the Shatt-el-Ha&#299; and a little less than 10 m. N.
of the modern Turkish town of Shatra. These ruins were discovered
in 1877 by Ernest de Sarzec, at that time French consul
at Basra, who was allowed, by the Montefich chief, Nasir Pasha,
the first Wali-Pasha, or governor-general, of Basra, to excavate
at his pleasure in the territories subject to that official. At
the outset on his own account, and later as a representative of
the French government, under a Turkish firman, de Sarzec
continued excavations at this site, with various intermissions,
until his death in 1901, after which the work was continued under
the supervision of the Commandant Cros. The principal excavations
were made in two larger mounds, one of which proved to
be the site of the temple, E-Ninnu, the shrine of the patron god
of Lagash, Nin-girsu or Ninib. This temple had been razed and
a fortress built upon its ruins, in the Greek or Seleucid period,
some of the bricks found bearing the inscription in Aramaic
and Greek of a certain Hadad-nadin-akhe, king of a small
Babylonian kingdom. It was beneath this fortress that the
numerous statues of Gudea were found, which constitute the
gem of the Babylonian collections at the Louvre. These had
been decapitated and otherwise mutilated, and thrown into the
foundations of the new fortress. From this stratum came also
various fragments of bas reliefs of high artistic excellence. The
excavations in the other larger mound resulted in the discovery
of the remains of buildings containing objects of all sorts in
bronze and stone, dating from the earliest Sumerian period
onward, and enabling us to trace the art history of Babylonia
to a date some hundreds of years before the time of Gudea.
Apparently this mound had been occupied largely by store
houses, in which were stored not only grain, figs, &amp;c., but also
vessels, weapons, sculptures and every possible object connected
with the use and administration of palace and temple. In a
small outlying mound de Sarzec discovered the archives of
the temple, about 30,000 inscribed clay tablets, containing
the business records, and revealing with extraordinary minuteness
the administration of an ancient Babylonian temple, the
character of its property, the method of farming its lands, herding
its flocks, and its commercial and industrial dealings and enterprises;
for an ancient Babylonian temple was a great industrial,
commercial, agricultural and stock-raising establishment. Unfortunately,
before these archives could be removed, the galleries
containing them were rifled by the Arabs, and large numbers
of the tablets were sold to antiquity dealers, by whom they have
been scattered all over Europe and America. From the inscriptions
found at Tello, it appears that Lagash was a city of great
importance in the Sumerian period, some time probably in the
4th millennium <span class="scs">B.C.</span> It was at that time ruled by independent
kings, Ur-Nina and his successors, who were engaged in contests
with the Elamites on the east and the kings of Kengi and Kish
on the north. With the Semitic conquest it lost its independence,
its rulers becoming <i>patesis</i>, dependent rulers, under Sargon and
his successors; but it still remained Sumerian and continued to
be a city of much importance, and, above all, a centre of artistic
development. Indeed, it was in this period and under the
immediately succeeding supremacy of the kings of Ur, Ur-Gur
and Dungi, that it reached its highest artistic development. At
this period, also, under its <i>patesis</i>, Ur-bau and Gudea, Lagash had
extensive commercial communications with distant realms.
According to his own records, Gudea brought cedars from the
Amanus and Lebanon mountains in Syria, diorite or dolorite
from eastern Arabia, copper and gold from central and southern
Arabia and from Sinai, while his armies, presumably under his
overlord, Ur-Gur, were engaged in battles in Elam on the east.
His was especially the era of artistic development. Some of
the earlier works of Ur-Nina, En-anna-tum, Entemena and
others, before the Semitic conquest, are also extremely interesting,
especially the famous stele of the vultures and a great silver vase
ornamented with what may be called the coat of arms of Lagash,
a lion-headed eagle with wings outspread, grasping a lion in each
talon. After the time of Gudea, Lagash seems to have lost its
importance; at least we know nothing more about it until the
construction of the Seleucid fortress mentioned, when it seems
to have become part of the Greek kingdom of Characene. The
objects found at Tello are the most valuable art treasures up to
this time discovered in Babylonia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAGHMAN<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span>, a district of Afghanistan, in the province of
Jalalabad, between Jalalabad and Kabul, on the northern side
of the Peshawar road, one of the richest and most fertile tracts
in Afghanistan. It is the valley of the Kabul river between the
Tagao and the Kunar and merges on the north into Kafiristan.
The inhabitants, Ghilzais and Tajiks, are supposed to be the
cleverest business people in the country. Sugar, cotton and
rice are exported to Kabul. The Laghman route between Kabul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
and India crossing the Kunar river into the Mohmand country
is the route followed by Alexander the Great and Baber; but
it has now been supplanted by the Khyber.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAGOON<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> (Fr. <i>lagune</i>, Lat. <i>lacuna</i>, a pool), a term applied to
(1) a sheet of salt or brackish water near the sea, (2) a sheet of
fresh water of no great depth or extent, (3) the expanse of smooth
water enclosed by an atoll. Sea lagoons are formed only where
the shores are low and protected from wave action. Under these
conditions a bar may be raised above sea-level or a spit may
grow until its end touches the land. The enclosed shallow water
is then isolated in a wide stretch, the seaward banks broaden,
and the lagoon becomes a permanent area of still shallow water
with peculiar faunal features. In the old lake plains of Australia
there are occasional wide and shallow depressions where water
collects permanently. Large numbers of aquatic birds, black
swans, wild duck, teal, migrant spoon-bills or pelicans, resort
to these fresh-water lagoons.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAGOS<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span>, the western province of Southern Nigeria, a British
colony and protectorate in West Africa. The province consists
of three divisions: (1) the coast region, including Lagos Island,
being the former colony of Lagos; (2) small native states
adjacent to the colony; and (3) the Yoruba country, farther
inland. The total area is some 27,000 sq. m., or about the size
of Scotland. The province is bounded S. by the Gulf of Guinea,
(from 2° 46&prime; 55&Prime; to 4° 30&prime; E.); W. by the French colony of
Dahomey; N. and E. by other provinces of Nigeria.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;The coast is low, marshy and malarious, and
all along the shore the great Atlantic billows cause a dangerous surf.
Behind the coast-line stretches a series of lagoons, in which are small
islands, that of Lagos having an area of 3¾ sq. m. Beyond the
lagoons and mangrove swamps is a broad zone of dense primeval
forest&mdash;&ldquo;the bush&rdquo;&mdash;which completely separates the arable lands
from the coast lagoons. The water-parting of the streams flowing
north to the Niger, and south to the Gulf of Guinea, is the main
physical feature. The general level of Yorubaland is under 2000 ft.
But towards the east, about the upper course of the river Oshun, the
elevation is higher. Southward from the divide the land, which is
intersected by the nearly parallel courses of the rivers Ogun, Omi,
Oshun, Oni and Oluwa, falls in continuous undulations to the coast,
the open cultivated ground gradually giving place to forest tracts,
where the most characteristic tree is the oil-palm. Flowering trees,
certain kinds of rubber vines, and shrubs are plentiful. In the
northern regions the shea-butter tree is found. The fauna resembles
that of the other regions of the Guinea coast, but large game is
becoming scarce. Leopards, antelopes and monkeys are common,
and alligators infest the rivers.</p>

<p>The lagoons, lying between the outer surf-beaten beach and the
inner shore line, form a navigable highway of still waters, many miles
in extent. They are almost entirely free from rock, though they are
often shallow, with numerous mud banks. The most extensive are
Lekki in the east, and Ikoradu (Lagos) in the west. At its N.W.
extremity the Lagos lagoon receives the Ogun, the largest river in
Yorubaland, whose current is strong enough to keep the seaward
channel open throughout the year. Hence the importance of the
port of Lagos, which lies in smooth water at the northern end of this
channel. The outer entrance is obstructed by a dangerous sand bar.</p>

<p><i>Climate and Health.</i>&mdash;The climate is unhealthy, especially for
Europeans. The rainfall has not been ascertained in the interior.
In the northern districts it is probably considerably less than at
Lagos, where it is about 70 in. a year. The variation is, however, very
great. In 1901 the rainfall was 112 in., in 1902 but 47, these figures
being respectively the highest and lowest recorded in a period of
seventeen years. The mean temperature at Lagos is 82.5° F., the
range being from 68° to 91°. At certain seasons sudden heavy squalls
of wind and rain that last for a few hours are common. The hurricane
and typhoon are unknown. The principal diseases are malarial
fever, smallpox, rheumatism, peripheral neuritis, dysentery, chest
diseases and guinea-worm. Fever not unfrequently assumes the
dangerous form known as &ldquo;black-water fever.&rdquo; The frequency
of smallpox is being much diminished outside the larger towns in the
interior, in which vaccination is neglected. The absence of plague,
yellow fever, cholera, typhoid fever and scarlatina is noteworthy.
A mild form of yaws is endemic.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Inhabitants.</i>&mdash;The population is estimated at 1,750,000. The
Yoruba people, a Negro race divided into many tribes, form the
majority of the inhabitants. Notwithstanding their political
feuds and their proved capacity as fighting men, the Yoruba
are distinguished above all the surrounding races for their
generally peaceful disposition, industry, friendliness, courtesy
and hospitality towards strangers. They are also intensely
patriotic. Physically they resemble closely their Ewe and
Dahomey neighbours, but are of somewhat lighter complexion,
taller and of less pronounced Negro features. They exhibit
high administrative ability, possess a marked capacity for trade,
and have made remarkable progress in the industrial arts. The
different tribes are distinguished by tattoo markings, usually
some simple pattern of two or more parallel lines, disposed
horizontally or vertically on the cheeks or other parts of the
face. The feeling for religion is deeply implanted among the
Yoruba. The majority are pagans, or dominated by pagan beliefs,
but Islam has made great progress since the cessation of the
Fula wars, while Protestant and Roman Catholic missions have
been at work since 1848 at Abeokuta, Oyo, Ibadan and other
large towns. Samuel Crowther, the first Negro bishop in the
Anglican church, who was distinguished as an explorer, geographer
and linguist, was a native of Yorubaland, rescued
(1822) by the English from slavery and educated at Sierra Leone
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Yorubas</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Towns.</i>&mdash;Besides Lagos (<i>q.v.</i>), pop. about 50,000, the chief
towns in the colony proper are Epe, pop. 16,000, on the northern
side of the lagoons, and Badagry (a notorious place during the
slave-trade period) and Lekki, both on the coast. Inland the
chief towns are Abeokuta (<i>q.v.</i>), pop. about 60,000, and Ibadan
(<i>q.v.</i>), pop. estimated at 150,000.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture and Trade.</i>&mdash;The chief wealth of the country
consists in forest produce, the staple industries being the collection
of palm-kernels and palm oil. Besides the oil-palm forests
large areas are covered with timber trees, the wood chiefly cut
for commercial purposes being a kind of mahogany. The destruction
of immature trees and the fluctuations in price render this a
very uncertain trade. The rubber industry was started in 1894,
and in 1896 the rubber exported was valued at £347,000. In
1899, owing to reckless methods of tapping the vines, 75% of
the rubber plants died. Precautions were then taken to preserve
the remainder and allow young plants to grow. The collection
of rubber recommenced in 1904 and the industry again became
one of importance. A considerable area is devoted to cocoa
plantations, all owned by native cultivators. Coffee and tobacco
of good quality are cultivated and shea-butter is largely used as
an illuminant. The Yoruba country is the greatest agricultural
centre in West Africa. For home consumption the Yoruba
grow yams, maize and millet, the chief articles of food, cassava,
sweet potatoes, sesame and beans. Model farms have been
established for experimental culture and for the tuition of the
natives. A palatable wine is obtained from the <i>Raphia vinifera</i>
and native beers are also brewed. Imported spirits are largely
consumed. There are no manufactures on a large scale save
the making of &ldquo;country cloths&rdquo; (from cotton grown, spun and
woven in the country) and mats. Pottery and agricultural
implements are made, and tanning, dyeing and forging practised
in the towns, and along the rivers and lagoons boats and canoes
are built. Fishing is extensively engaged in, the fish being
dried and sent up country. Except iron there are no valuable
minerals in the country.</p>

<p>The cotton plant from which the &ldquo;country cloths&rdquo; are made
is native to the country, the soil of which is capable of producing
the very finest grades of cotton. The Egba branch of the Yoruba
have always grown the plant. In 1869 the cotton exported was
valued at £76,957, but owing to low prices the natives ceased to
grow cotton for export, so that in 1879 the value of exported
cotton was only £526. In 1902 planting for export was recommenced
by the Egba on scientific lines, and was started in the
Abeokuta district with encouraging results.</p>

<p>The Yoruba profess to be unable to alienate land in perpetuity,
but native custom does not preclude leasing, and land
concessions have been taken up by Europeans on long leases.
Some concessions are only for cutting and removing timber;
others permit of cultivation. The northern parts of the protectorate
are specially suitable for stock raising and poultry
culture.</p>

<p>The chief exports are palm-kernels, palm-oil, timber, rubber
and cocoa. Palm-kernels alone constitute more than a half in
value of the total exports, and with palm-oil over three-fourths.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
The trade in these products is practically confined to Great
Britain and Germany, the share of the first-named being 25%
to Germany&rsquo;s 75%. Minor exports are coffee, &ldquo;country
cloths,&rdquo; maize, shea-butter and ivory.</p>

<p>Cotton goods are the most important of the imports, spirits
coming next, followed by building material, haberdashery and
hardware and tobacco. Over 90% of the cotton goods are
imported from Great Britain, whilst nearly the same proportion
of the spirit imports come from Germany. Nearly all the
liquors consist of &ldquo;Trade Spirits,&rdquo; chiefly gin, rum and a concoction
called &ldquo;alcohol,&rdquo; introduced (1901) to meet the growing
taste of the people for stronger liquor. This stuff contained 90%
of pure alcohol and sometimes over 4% of fusel oil. To hinder
the sale of this noxious compound legislation was passed in 1903
prohibiting the import of liquor containing more than ½%
of fusel oil, whilst the states of Abeokuta and Ibadan prohibited
the importation of liquor stronger than proof. The total trade
of the country in 1905 was valued at £2,224,754, the imports
slightly exceeding the exports. There is a large transit trade
with Dahomey.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;Lagos is well supplied with means of communication.
A 3 ft. 6 in. gauge railway starts from Iddo Island, and
extends past Abeokuta, 64 m. from Lagos, Ibadan (123 m.), Oshogbo
(175 m.), to Illorin (247 m.) in Northern Nigeria, whence the line is
continued to Jebba and Zunguru (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nigeria</a></span>). Abeokuta is served
by a branch line, 1½ m. long, from Aro on the main line. Railway
bridges connect Iddo Island both with the mainland and with Lagos
Island (see Lagos, town). This line was begun in 1896 and opened
to Ibadan in 1901. In 1905 the building of the section Ibadan-Illorin
was undertaken. The railway was built by the government
and cost about £7000 per mile. The lagoons offer convenient channels
for numerous small craft, which, with the exception of steam-launches,
are almost entirely native-built canoes. Branch steamers
run between the Forcados mouth of the Niger and Lagos, and also
between Lagos and Porto Novo, in French territory, and do a large
transit trade. Various roads through the bush have been made by
the government. There is telegraphic communication with Europe,
Northern Nigeria and South Africa, and steamships ply regularly
between Lagos and Liverpool, and Lagos and Hamburg (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lagos</a></span>,
town).</p>

<p><i>Administration, Justice, Education, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The small part of the
province which constitutes &ldquo;the colony of Southern Nigeria&rdquo; is
governed as a crown colony. Elsewhere the native governments are
retained, the chiefs and councils of elders receiving the advice and
support of British commissioners. There is also an advisory native
central council which meets at Lagos. The great majority of the
civil servants are natives of the country, some of whom have been
educated in England. The legal status of slavery is not recognized
by the law courts and dealing in slaves is suppressed. As an institution
slavery is dying out, and only exists in a domestic form.</p>

<p>The cost of administration is met, mainly, by customs, largely derived
from the duties on imported spirits. From the railways, a
government monopoly, a considerable net profit is earned. Expenditure
is mainly under the heads of railway administration, other
public works, military and police, health, and education. The
revenue increased in the ten years 1895-1905 from £142,049 to
£410,250. In the same period the expenditure rose from £144,484
to £354,254.</p>

<p>The defence of the province is entrusted to the Lagos battalion of
the West African Frontier Force, a body under the control of the
Colonial Office in London and composed of Hausa (four-fifths) and
Yoruba. It is officered from the British army.</p>

<p>The judicial system in the colony proper is based on that of
England. The colonial supreme court, by agreement with the rulers
of Abeokuta, Ibadan and other states in the protectorate, tries, with
the aid of native assessors, all cases of importance in those countries.
Other cases are tried by mixed courts, or, where Yoruba alone are
concerned, by native courts.</p>

<p>There is a government board of education which maintains a few schools
and supervises those voluntarily established. These are
chiefly those of various missionary societies, who, besides primary
schools, have a few secondary schools. The Mahommedans have
their own schools. Grants from public funds are made to the
voluntary schools. Considerable attention is paid to manual training,
the laws of health and the teaching of English, which is spoken
by about one-fourth of the native population.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Lagos Island was so named by the Portuguese
explorers of the 15th century, because of the numerous lagoons
or lakes on this part of the coast. The Portuguese, and after
them the French, had settlements here at various points. In
the 18th century Lagos Lagoon became the chief resort of slavers
frequenting the Bight of Benin, this portion of the Gulf of
Guinea becoming known pre-eminently as the Slave Coast.
British traders established themselves at Badagry, 40 m. W.
of Lagos, where in 1851 they were attacked by Kosoko, the
Yoruba king of Lagos Island. As a result a British naval force
seized Lagos after a sharp fight and deposed the king, placing
his cousin, Akitoye, on the throne. A treaty was concluded
under which Akitoye bound himself to put down the slave
trade. This treaty was not adhered to, and in 1861 Akitoye&rsquo;s
son and successor, King Docemo, was induced to give up his
territorial jurisdiction and accept a pension of 1200 bags of
cowries, afterwards commuted to £1000 a year, which pension
he drew until his death in 1885. Immediately after the proclamation
of the British annexation, a steady current of immigration
from the mainland set in, and a flourishing town arose on Lagos
Island. Iddo Island was acquired at the same time as Lagos
Island, and from 1862 to 1894 various additions by purchase
or cession were made to the colony. In 1879 the small kingdom
of Kotonu was placed under British protection. Kotonu lies
south and east of the Denham Lagoon (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dahomey</a></span>). In
1889 it was exchanged with the French for the kingdom of Pokra
which is to the north of Badagry. In the early years of the colony
Sir John Glover, R.N., who was twice governor (1864-1866 and
1871-1872), did much pioneer work and earned the confidence
of the natives to a remarkable degree. Later Sir C. A. Moloney
(governor 1886-1890) opened up relations with the Yoruba
and other tribes in the hinterland. He despatched two commissioners
whose duty it was to conclude commercial treaties
and use British influence to put a stop to inter-tribal fighting
and the closing of the trade routes. In 1892 the Jebu, who acted
as middlemen between the colony and the Yoruba, closed several
trade routes. An expedition sent against them resulted in their
subjugation and the annexation of part of their country. An
order in council issued in 1899 extended the protectorate over
Yorubaland. The tribes of the hinterland have largely welcomed
the British protectorate and military expeditions have been
few and unimportant. (For the history of the Yoruba states
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Yorubas</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Lagos was made a separate government in 1863; in 1866 it
was placed in political dependence upon Sierra Leone; in 1874
it became (politically) an integral part of the Gold Coast Colony,
whilst in 1886 it was again made a separate government, administered
as a crown colony. In Sir William Macgregor, M.D.,
formerly administrator of British New Guinea, governor 1899-1904,
the colony found an enlightened ruler. He inaugurated
the railway system, and drew much closer the friendly ties
between the British and the tribes of the protectorate. Meantime,
since 1884, the whole of the Niger delta, lying immediately
east of Lagos, as well as the Hausa states and Bornu, had been
acquired by Great Britain. Unification of the British possessions
in Nigeria being desirable, the delta regions and Lagos were
formed in 1906 into one government (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nigeria</a></span>).</p>

and protectorate of Southern Nigeria, in 6° 26&prime; N., 3° 23&prime; E. on
an island in a lagoon named Lagos also. Between Lagos and
the mainland is Iddo Island. An iron bridge for road and railway
traffic 2600 ft. long connects Lagos and Iddo Islands, and
another iron bridge, 917 ft. long, joins Iddo Island to the mainland.
The town lies but a foot or two above sea-level. The
principal buildings are a large government house, the law courts,
the memorial hall erected to commemorate the services of Sir
John Glover, used for public meetings and entertainments,
an elaborate club-house provided from public funds, and the
police quarters. There are many substantial villas that serve
as quarters for the officers of the civil service, as well as numerous
solidly-built handsome private buildings. The streets are well
kept; the town is supplied with electric light, and there is a
good water service. The chief stores and depôts for goods are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
all on the banks of the lagoon. The swamps of which originally
Lagos Island entirely consisted have been reclaimed. In
connexion with this work a canal, 25 ft. wide, has been cut right
through the island and a sea-wall built round its western half.
There is a commodious public hospital, of the cottage type,
on a good site. There is a racecourse, which also serves as a
general public recreation ground. Shifting banks of sand form
a bar at the sea entrance of the lagoon. Extensive works were
undertaken in 1908 with a view to making Lagos an open port.
A mole has been built at the eastern entrance to the harbour
and dredgers are at work on the bar, which can be crossed by
vessels drawing 13 ft. Large ocean-going steamers anchor
not less than 2 m. from land, and goods and passengers are
there transhipped into smaller steamers for Lagos. Heavy
cargo is carried by the large steamers to Forcados, 200 m. farther
down the coast, transhipped there into branch boats, and taken
via the lagoons to Lagos. The port is 4279 m. from Liverpool,
1203 from Freetown, Sierra Leone (the nearest safe port westward),
and 315 from Cape Coast.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, about 50,000, include, besides the native
tribes, Sierra Leonis, Fanti, Krumen and the descendants of
some 6000 Brazilian <i>emancipados</i> who were settled here in the
early days of British rule. The Europeans number about 400.
Rather more than half the populace are Moslems.</p>

visited by the British Channel fleet. Vines and figs are extensively
cultivated in the neighbourhood, and Lagos is the centre of
important sardine and tunny fisheries. Its trade is chiefly
carried on by small coasting vessels, as there is no railway.
Lagos is on or near the site of the Roman <i>Lacobriga</i>. Since the
15th century it has held the formal rank and title of city. Cape
St Vincent, the ancient <i>Promontorium Sacrum</i>, and the south-western

for its connexion with Prince Henry (<i>q.v.</i>), the Navigator, who
here founded the town of Sagres in 1421; and for several
British naval victories, the most celebrated of which was won
in 1797 by Admiral Jervis (afterwards Earl St Vincent) over a
larger Spanish squadron. In 1759 Admiral Boscawen defeated
a French fleet off Lagos. The great earthquake of 1755 destroyed

<p><span class="bold">LAGRANGE, JOSEPH LOUIS<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> (1736-1813), French mathematician,
was born at Turin, on the 25th of January 1736. He
was of French extraction, his great grandfather, a cavalry
captain, having passed from the service of France to that of
Sardinia, and settled in Turin under Emmanuel II. His father,
Joseph Louis Lagrange, married Maria Theresa Gros, only
daughter of a rich physician at Cambiano, and had by her eleven
children, of whom only the eldest (the subject of this notice)
and the youngest survived infancy. His emoluments as treasurer
at war, together with his wife&rsquo;s fortune, provided him with
ample means, which he lost by rash speculations, a circumstance
regarded by his son as the prelude to his own good fortune; for
had he been rich, he used to say, he might never have known
mathematics.</p>

<p>The genius of Lagrange did not at once take its true bent.
His earliest tastes were literary rather than scientific, and he
learned the rudiments of geometry during his first year at the
college of Turin, without difficulty, but without distinction.
The perusal of a tract by Halley (<i>Phil. Trans</i>. xviii. 960)
roused his enthusiasm for the analytical method, of which he
was destined to develop the utmost capabilities. He now entered,
unaided save by his own unerring tact and vivid apprehension,
upon a course of study which, in two years, placed him on a level
with the greatest of his contemporaries. At the age of nineteen
he communicated to Leonhard Euler his idea of a general method
of dealing with &ldquo;isoperimetrical&rdquo; problems, known later as
the Calculus of Variations. It was eagerly welcomed by the
Berlin mathematician, who had the generosity to withhold from
publication his own further researches on the subject, until his
youthful correspondent should have had time to complete and
opportunity to claim the invention. This prosperous opening
gave the key-note to Lagrange&rsquo;s career. Appointed, in 1754,
professor of geometry in the royal school of artillery, he formed
with some of his pupils&mdash;for the most part his seniors&mdash;friendships
based on community of scientific ardour. With the aid of
the marquis de Saluces and the anatomist G. F. Cigna, he
founded in 1758 a society which became the Turin Academy of
Sciences. The first volume of its memoirs, published in the
following year, contained a paper by Lagrange entitled <i>Recherches
sur la nature et la propagation du son</i>, in which the power of his
analysis and his address in its application were equally conspicuous.
He made his first appearance in public as the critic
of Newton, and the arbiter between d&rsquo;Alembert and Euler. By
considering only the particles of air found in a right line, he
reduced the problem of the propagation of sound to the solution of
the same partial differential equations that include the motions
of vibrating strings, and demonstrated the insufficiency of the
methods employed by both his great contemporaries in dealing
with the latter subject. He further treated in a masterly manner
of echoes and the mixture of sounds, and explained the phenomenon
of grave harmonics as due to the occurrence of beats so
rapid as to generate a musical note. This was followed, in the
second volume of the <i>Miscellanea Taurinensia</i> (1762) by his
&ldquo;Essai d&rsquo;une nouvelle méthode pour déterminer les maxima et
les minima des formules intégrales indéfinies,&rdquo; together with the
application of this important development of analysis to the
solution of several dynamical problems, as well as to the demonstration
of the mechanical principle of &ldquo;least action.&rdquo; The
essential point in his advance on Euler&rsquo;s mode of investigating
curves of maximum or minimum consisted in his purely analytical
conception of the subject. He not only freed it from all trammels
of geometrical construction, but by the introduction of the
symbol &delta; gave it the efficacy of a new calculus. He is thus justly
regarded as the inventor of the &ldquo;method of variations&rdquo;&mdash;a
name supplied by Euler in 1766.</p>

<p>By these performances Lagrange found himself, at the age
of twenty-six, on the summit of European fame. Such a height
had not been reached without cost. Intense application during
early youth had weakened a constitution never robust, and led
to accesses of feverish exaltation culminating, in the spring of
1761, in an attack of bilious hypochondria, which permanently
lowered the tone of his nervous system. Rest and exercise,
however, temporarily restored his health, and he gave proof
of the undiminished vigour of his powers by carrying off, in
1764, the prize offered by the Paris Academy of Sciences for the
best essay on the libration of the moon. His treatise was remarkable,
not only as offering a satisfactory explanation of the coincidence
between the lunar periods of rotation and revolution,
but as containing the first employment of his radical formula
of mechanics, obtained by combining with the principle of
d&rsquo;Alembert that of virtual velocities. His success encouraged
the Academy to propose, in 1766, as a theme for competition, the
hitherto unattempted theory of the Jovian system. The prize
was again awarded to Lagrange; and he earned the same distinction
with essays on the problem of three bodies in 1772, on
the secular equation of the moon in 1774, and in 1778 on the
theory of cometary perturbations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span></p>

<p>He had in the meantime gratified a long felt desire by a visit
to Paris, where he enjoyed the stimulating delight of conversing
with such mathematicians as A. C. Clairault, d&rsquo;Alembert,
Condorcet and the Abbé Marie. Illness prevented him from
visiting London. The post of director of the mathematical
department of the Berlin Academy (of which he had been a
member since 1759) becoming vacant by the removal of Euler
to St Petersburg, the latter and d&rsquo;Alembert united to recommend
Lagrange as his successor. Euler&rsquo;s eulogium was enhanced by
his desire to quit Berlin, d&rsquo;Alembert&rsquo;s by his dread of a royal
command to repair thither; and the result was that an invitation,
conveying the wish of the &ldquo;greatest king in Europe&rdquo; to
have the &ldquo;greatest mathematician&rdquo; at his court, was sent to
Turin. On the 6th of November 1766, Lagrange was installed
in his new position, with a salary of 6000 francs, ample leisure
for scientific research, and royal favour sufficient to secure him
respect without exciting envy. The national jealousy of
foreigners, was at first a source of annoyance to him; but such
prejudices were gradually disarmed by the inoffensiveness of his
demeanour. We are told that the universal example of his
colleagues, rather than any desire for female society, impelled
him to matrimony; his choice being a lady of the Conti family,
who, by his request, joined him at Berlin. Soon after marriage
his wife was attacked by a lingering illness, to which she succumbed,
Lagrange devoting all his time, and a considerable store
of medical knowledge, to her care.</p>

<p>The long series of memoirs&mdash;some of them complete treatises
of great moment in the history of science&mdash;communicated by
Lagrange to the Berlin Academy between the years 1767 and
1787 were not the only fruits of his exile. His <i>Mécanique
analytique</i>, in which his genius most fully displayed itself, was
produced during the same period. This great work was the
perfect realization of a design conceived by the author almost
in boyhood, and clearly sketched in his first published essay.<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
Its scope may be briefly described as the reduction of the theory
of mechanics to certain general formulae, from the simple
development of which should be derived the equations necessary
for the solution of each separate problem.<a name="fa2i" id="fa2i" href="#ft2i"><span class="sp">2</span></a> From the fundamental
principle of virtual velocities, which thus acquired a new
significance, Lagrange deduced, with the aid of the calculus
of variations, the whole system of mechanical truths, by processes
so elegant, lucid and harmonious as to constitute, in Sir
William Hamilton&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;a kind of scientific poem.&rdquo; This
unification of method was one of matter also. By his mode of
regarding a liquid as a material system characterized by the
unshackled mobility of its minutest parts, the separation between
the mechanics of matter in different forms of aggregation finally
disappeared, and the fundamental equation of forces was for
the first time extended to hydrostatics and hydrodynamics.<a name="fa3i" id="fa3i" href="#ft3i"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
Thus a universal science of matter and motion was derived, by
an unbroken sequence of deduction, from one radical principle;
and analytical mechanics assumed the clear and complete form
of logical perfection which it now wears.</p>

<p>A publisher having with some difficulty been found, the book
appeared at Paris in 1788 under the supervision of A. M. Legendre.
But before that time Lagrange himself was on the spot. After
the death of Frederick the Great, his presence was competed
for by the courts of France, Spain and Naples, and a residence
in Berlin having ceased to possess any attraction for him, he
removed to Paris in 1787. Marie Antoinette warmly patronized
him. He was lodged in the Louvre, received the grant of an
income equal to that he had hitherto enjoyed, and, with the
title of &ldquo;veteran pensioner&rdquo; in lieu of that of &ldquo;foreign associate&rdquo;
(conferred in 1772), the right of voting at the deliberations of the
Academy. In the midst of these distinctions, a profound
melancholy seized upon him. His mathematical enthusiasm
was for the time completely quenched, and during two years
the printed volume of his <i>Mécanique</i>, which he had seen only in
manuscript, lay unopened beside him. He relieved his dejection
with miscellaneous studies, especially with that of chemistry,
which, in the new form given to it by Lavoisier, he found &ldquo;aisée
comme l&rsquo;algèbre.&rdquo; The Revolution roused him once more to
activity and cheerfulness. Curiosity impelled him to remain
and watch the progress of such a novel phenomenon; but
curiosity was changed into dismay as the terrific character of the
phenomenon unfolded itself. He now bitterly regretted his
temerity in braving the danger. &ldquo;Tu l&rsquo;as voulu&rdquo; he would
repeat self-reproachfully. Even from revolutionary tribunals,
however, the name of Lagrange uniformly commanded respect.
His pension was continued by the National Assembly, and he
was partially indemnified for the depreciation of the currency
by remunerative appointments. Nominated president of the
Academical commission for the reform of weights and measures,
his services were retained when its &ldquo;purification&rdquo; by the
Jacobins removed his most distinguished colleagues. He again
sat on the commission of 1799 for the construction of the metric
system, and by his zealous advocacy of the decimal principle
largely contributed to its adoption.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the 31st of May 1792 he married Mademoiselle
Lemonnier, daughter of the astronomer of that name, a young
and beautiful girl, whose devotion ignored disparity of years,
and formed the one tie with life which Lagrange found it hard to
break. He had no children by either marriage. Although
specially exempted from the operation of the decree of October
1793, imposing banishment on foreign residents, he took alarm
at the fate of J. S. Bailly and A. L. Lavoisier, and prepared
to resume his former situation in Berlin. His design was frustrated
by the establishment of and his official connexion with
the École Normale, and the École Polytechnique. The former
institution had an ephemeral existence; but amongst the
benefits derived from the foundation of the École Polytechnique
one of the greatest, it has been observed,<a name="fa4i" id="fa4i" href="#ft4i"><span class="sp">4</span></a> was the restoration
of Lagrange to mathematics. The remembrance of his teachings
was long treasured by such of his auditors&mdash;amongst whom
were J. B. J. Delambre and S. F. Lacroix&mdash;as were capable of
appreciating them. In expounding the principles of the differential
calculus, he started, as it were, from the level of his pupils,
and ascended with them by almost insensible gradations from
elementary to abstruse conceptions. He seemed, not a professor
amongst students, but a learner amongst learners; pauses for
thought alternated with luminous exposition; invention
accompanied demonstration; and thus originated his <i>Théorie
des fonctions analytiques</i> (Paris, 1797). The leading idea of this
work was contained in a paper published in the <i>Berlin Memoirs</i>
for 1772.<a name="fa5i" id="fa5i" href="#ft5i"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Its object was the elimination of the, to some minds,
unsatisfactory conception of the infinite from the metaphysics
of the higher mathematics, and the substitution for the differential
and integral calculus of an analogous method depending wholly
on the serial development of algebraical functions. By means
of this &ldquo;calculus of derived functions&rdquo; Lagrange hoped to give
to the solution of all analytical problems the utmost &ldquo;rigour of
the demonstrations of the ancients&rdquo;;<a name="fa6i" id="fa6i" href="#ft6i"><span class="sp">6</span></a> but it cannot be said
that the attempt was successful. The validity of his fundamental
position was impaired by the absence of a well-constituted
theory of series; the notation employed was inconvenient,
and was abandoned by its inventor in the second edition of his
<i>Mécanique</i>; while his scruples as to the admission into analytical
investigations of the idea of limits or vanishing ratios have long
since been laid aside as idle. Nowhere, however, were the
keenness and clearness of his intellect more conspicuous than
in this brilliant effort, which, if it failed in its immediate object,
was highly effective in secondary results. His purely abstract
mode of regarding functions, apart from any mechanical or
geometrical considerations, led the way to a new and sharply
characterized development of the higher analysis in the hands
of A. Cauchy, C. G. Jacobi, and others.<a name="fa7i" id="fa7i" href="#ft7i"><span class="sp">7</span></a> The <i>Théorie des
fonctions</i> is divided into three parts, of which the first explains
the general doctrine of functions, the second deals with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>
application to geometry, and the third with its bearings on
mechanics.</p>

<p>On the establishment of the Institute, Lagrange was placed
at the head of the section of geometry; he was one of the first
members of the Bureau des Longitudes; and his name appeared
in 1791 on the list of foreign members of the Royal Society.
On the annexation of Piedmont to France in 1796, a touching
compliment was paid to him in the person of his aged father.
By direction of Talleyrand, then minister for foreign affairs,
the French commissary repaired in state to the old man&rsquo;s
residence in Turin, to congratulate him on the merits of his son,
whom they declared &ldquo;to have done honour to mankind by his
genius, and whom Piedmont was proud to have produced, and
France to possess.&rdquo; Bonaparte, who styled him &ldquo;la haute
pyramide des sciences mathématiques,&rdquo; loaded him with personal
favours and official distinctions. He became a senator, a count
of the empire, a grand officer of the legion of honour, and just
before his death received the grand cross of the order of réunion.</p>

<p>The preparation of a new edition of his <i>Mécanique</i> exhausted
his already falling powers. Frequent fainting fits gave presage
of a speedy end, and on the 8th of April 1813 he had a final
interview with his friends B. Lacépède, G. Monge and J. A.
Chaptal. He spoke with the utmost calm of his approaching
death; &ldquo;c&rsquo;est une dernière fonction,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;qui n&rsquo;est ni
pénible ni désagréable.&rdquo; He nevertheless looked forward to a
future meeting, when he promised to complete the autobiographical
details which weakness obliged him to interrupt.
They remained untold, for he died two days later on the 10th of
April, and was buried in the Pantheon, the funeral oration being
pronounced by Laplace and Lacépède.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Amongst the brilliant group of mathematicians whose magnanimous
rivalry contributed to accomplish the task of generalization
and deduction reserved for the 18th century, Lagrange occupies an
eminent place. It is indeed by no means easy to distinguish and
apportion the respective merits of the competitors. This is especially
the case between Lagrange and Euler on the one side, and between
Lagrange and Laplace on the other. The calculus of variations lay
undeveloped in Euler&rsquo;s mode of treating isoperimetrical problems.
The fruitful method, again, of the variation of elements was introduced
by Euler, but adopted and perfected by Lagrange, who first
recognized its supreme importance to the analytical investigation of
the planetary movements. Finally, of the grand series of researches
by which the stability of the solar system was ascertained, the glory
must be almost equally divided between Lagrange and Laplace.
In analytical invention, and mastery over the calculus, the Turin
mathematician was admittedly unrivalled. Laplace owned that he
had despaired of effecting the integration of the differential equations
relative to secular inequalities until Lagrange showed him the way.
But Laplace unquestionably surpassed his rival in practical sagacity
and the intuition of physical truth. Lagrange saw in the problems
of nature so many occasions for analytical triumphs; Laplace regarded
analytical triumphs as the means of solving the problems of
nature. One mind seemed the complement of the other; and both,
united in honourable rivalry, formed an instrument of unexampled
perfection for the investigation of the celestial machinery. What
may be called Lagrange&rsquo;s first period of research into planetary
perturbations extended from 1774 to 1784 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Astronomy</a></span>: <i>History</i>).
The notable group of treatises communicated, 1781-1784, to the
Berlin Academy was designed, but did not prove to be his final
contribution to the theory of the planets. After an interval of
twenty-four years the subject, re-opened by S. D. Poisson in a paper
read on the 20th of June 1808, was once more attacked by Lagrange
with all his pristine vigour and fertility of invention. Resuming the
inquiry into the invariability of mean motions, Poisson carried the
approximation, with Lagrange&rsquo;s formulae, as far as the squares of
the disturbing forces, hitherto neglected, with the same result as to
the stability of the system. He had not attempted to include in his
calculations the orbital variations of the disturbing bodies; but
Lagrange, by the happy artifice of transferring the origin of coordinates
from the centre of the sun to the centre of gravity of the
sun and planets, obtained a simplification of the formulae, by which
the same analysis was rendered equally applicable to each of the
planets severally. It deserves to be recorded as one of the numerous
coincidences of discovery that Laplace, on being made acquainted
by Lagrange with his new method, produced analogous expressions,
to which his independent researches had led him. The final achievement
of Lagrange in this direction was the extension of the method
of the variation of arbitrary constants, successfully used by him in
the investigation of periodical as well as of secular inequalities, to
any system whatever of mutually interacting bodies.<a name="fa8i" id="fa8i" href="#ft8i"><span class="sp">8</span></a> &ldquo;Not
without astonishment,&rdquo; even to himself, regard being had to the
great generality of the differential equations, he reached a result so
wide as to include, as a particular case, the solution of the planetary
problem recently obtained by him. He proposed to apply the same
principles to the calculation of the disturbances produced in the
rotation of the planets by external action on their equatorial protuberances,
but was anticipated by Poisson, who gave formulae for
the variation of the elements of rotation strictly corresponding with
those found by Lagrange for the variation of the elements of revolution.
The revision of the <i>Mécanique analytique</i> was undertaken
mainly for the purpose of embodying in it these new methods and
final results, but was interrupted, when two-thirds completed, by
the death of its author.</p>

<p>In the advancement of almost every branch of pure mathematics
Lagrange took a conspicuous part. The calculus of variations is
indissolubly associated with his name. In the theory of numbers
he furnished solutions of many of P. Fermat&rsquo;s theorems, and added
some of his own. In algebra he discovered the method of approximating
to the real roots of an equation by means of continued fractions,
and imagined a general process of solving algebraical equations
of every degree. The method indeed fails for equations of an order
above the fourth, because it then involves the solution of an equation
of higher dimensions than they proposed. Yet it possesses the
great and characteristic merit of generalizing the solutions of his
predecessors, exhibiting them all as modifications of one principle.
To Lagrange, perhaps more than to any other, the theory of differential
equations is indebted for its position as a science, rather than
a collection of ingenious artifices for the solution of particular
problems. To the calculus of finite differences he contributed the
beautiful formula of interpolation which bears his name; although
substantially the same result seems to have been previously obtained
by Euler. But it was in the application to mechanical questions of
the instrument which he thus helped to form that his singular merit
lay. It was his just boast to have transformed mechanics (defined by
him as a &ldquo;geometry of four dimensions&rdquo;) into a branch of analysis,
and to have exhibited the so-called mechanical &ldquo;principles&rdquo; as
simple results of the calculus. The method of &ldquo;generalized coordinates,&rdquo;
as it is now called, by which he attained this result, is
the most brilliant achievement of the analytical method. Instead
of following the motion of each individual part of a material system,
he showed that, if we determine its configuration by a sufficient
number of variables, whose number is that of the degrees of freedom
to move (there being as many equations as the system has degrees of
freedom), the kinetic and potential energies of the system can be
expressed in terms of these, and the differential equations of motion
thence deduced by simple differentiation. Besides this most important
contribution to the general fabric of dynamical science, we
owe to Lagrange several minor theorems of great elegance,&mdash;among
which may be mentioned his theorem that the kinetic energy imparted
by given impulses to a material system under given constraints
is a maximum. To this entire branch of knowledge, in short,
he successfully imparted that character of generality and completeness
towards which his labours invariably tended.</p>

<p>His share in the gigantic task of verifying the Newtonian theory
would alone suffice to immortalize his name. His co-operation was
indeed more indispensable than at first sight appears. Much as
was done <i>by</i> him, what was done <i>through</i> him was still more important.
Some of his brilliant rival&rsquo;s most conspicuous discoveries were
implicitly contained in his writings, and wanted but one step for
completion. But that one step, from the abstract to the concrete,
was precisely that which the character of Lagrange&rsquo;s mind indisposed
him to make. As notable instances may be mentioned Laplace&rsquo;s
discoveries relating to the velocity of sound and the secular acceleration
of the moon, both of which were led close up to by Lagrange&rsquo;s
analytical demonstrations. In the <i>Berlin Memoirs</i> for 1778 and 1783
Lagrange gave the first direct and theoretically perfect method of
determining cometary orbits. It has not indeed proved practically
available; but his system of calculating cometary perturbations
by means of &ldquo;mechanical quadratures&rdquo; has formed the starting-point
of all subsequent researches on the subject. His determination<a name="fa9i" id="fa9i" href="#ft9i"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
of maximum and minimum values for the slowly varying
planetary eccentricities was the earliest attempt to deal with the
problem. Without a more accurate knowledge of the masses of the
planets than was then possessed a satisfactory solution was impossible;
but the upper limits assigned by him agreed closely with
those obtained later by U. J. J. Leverrier.<a name="fa10i" id="fa10i" href="#ft10i"><span class="sp">10</span></a> As a mathematical
writer Lagrange has perhaps never been surpassed. His treatises
are not only storehouses of ingenious methods, but models of symmetrical
form. The clearness, elegance and originality of his mode
of presentation give lucidity to what is obscure, novelty to what is
familiar, and simplicity to what is abstruse. His genius was one of
generalization and abstraction; and the aspirations of the time
towards unity and perfection received, by his serene labours, an
embodiment denied to them in the troubled world of politics.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;Lagrange&rsquo;s numerous scattered memoirs have

<i>&OElig;uvres de Lagrange, publiées sous les soins de M. J. A. Serret</i> (Paris,
1867-1877). The first, second and third sections of this publication
comprise respectively the papers communicated by him to the
Academies of Sciences of Turin, Berlin and Paris; the fourth includes
his miscellaneous contributions to other scientific collections,
together with his additions to Euler&rsquo;s <i>Algebra</i>, and his <i>Leçons
élémentaires</i> at the École Normale in 1795. Delambre&rsquo;s notice of his
life, extracted from the <i>Mém. de l&rsquo;Institut</i>, 1812, is prefixed to the
first volume. Besides the separate works already named are <i>Résolution
des équations numériques</i> (1798, 2nd ed., 1808, 3rd ed., 1826),
and <i>Leçons sur le calcul des fonctions</i> (1805, 2nd ed., 1806), designed
as a commentary and supplement to the first part of the <i>Théorie des
fonctions</i>. The first volume of the enlarged edition of the <i>Mécanique</i>
appeared in 1811, the second, of which the revision was completed by
MM Prony and Binet, in 1815. A third edition, in 2 vols., 4to, was
issued in 1853-1855, and a second of the <i>Théorie des fonctions</i> in 1813.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAGRANGE-CHANCEL<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Chancel</span>], <span class="bold">FRANÇOIS JOSEPH</span>
(1677-1758), French dramatist and satirist, was born at Périgueux
on the 1st of January 1677. He was an extremely precocious
boy, and at Bordeaux, where he was educated, he produced a
play when he was nine years old. Five years later his mother
took him to Paris, where he found a patron in the princesse
de Conti, to whom he dedicated his tragedy of <i>Jugurtha</i> or, as it
was called later, <i>Adherbal</i> (1694). Racine had given him advice
and was present at the first performance, although he had long
lived in complete retirement. Other plays followed: <i>Oreste et
Pylade</i> (1697), <i>Méléagre</i> (1699), <i>Amasis</i> (1701), and <i>Ino et Mélicerte</i>
(1715). Lagrange hardly realized the high hopes raised by
his precocity, although his only serious rival on the tragic stage
was Campistron, but he obtained high favour at court, becoming
<i>maître d&rsquo;hôtel</i> to the duchess of Orleans. This prosperity ended
with the publication in 1720 of his <i>Philippiques</i>, odes accusing
the regent, Philip, duke of Orleans, of the most odious crimes.
He might have escaped the consequences of this libel but for
the bitter enmity of a former patron, the duc de La Force.
Lagrange found sanctuary at Avignon, but was enticed beyond
the boundary of the papal jurisdiction, when he was arrested
and sent as a prisoner to the isles of Sainte Marguerite. He
contrived, however, to escape to Sardinia and thence to Spain
and Holland, where he produced his fourth and fifth <i>Philippiques</i>.
On the death of the Regent he was able to return to France.
He was part author of a <i>Histoire de Périgord</i> left unfinished, and
made a further contribution to history, or perhaps, more exactly,
to romance, in a letter to Élie Fréron on the identity of the Man
with the Iron Mask. Lagrange&rsquo;s family life was embittered
by a long lawsuit against his son. He died at Périgueux at the
end of December 1758.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>He had collected his own works (5 vols., 1758) some months before
his death. His most famous work, the <i>Philippiques</i>, was edited by
M. de Lescure in 1858, and a sixth philippic by M. Diancourt in 1886.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA GRANJA<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">San Ildefonso</span>, a summer palace of the kings
of Spain; on the south-eastern border of the province of Segovia,
and on the western slopes of the Sierra de Guadarrama, 7 m.
by road S.E. of the city of Segovia. The royal estate is 3905
ft. above sea-level. The scenery of this region, especially in
the gorge of the river Lozoya, with its granite rocks, its dense
forest of pines, firs and birches, and its red-tiled farms, more
nearly resembles the highlands of northern Europe than any
other part of Spain. La Granja has an almost alpine climate,
with a clear, cool atmosphere and abundant sunshine. Above
the palace rise the wooded summits of the Guadarrama, culminating
in the peak of Peñalara (7891 ft.); in front of it the wide
plains of Segovia extend northwards. The village of San
Ildefonso, the oldest part of the estate, was founded in 1450
by Henry IV., who built a hunting lodge and chapel here. In
1477 the chapel was presented by Ferdinand and Isabella to
the monks of the Parral, a neighbouring Hieronymite monastery.
The original <i>granja</i> (<i>i.e.</i> grange or farm), established by the monks,
was purchased in 1719 by Philip V., after the destruction of his
summer palace at Valsain, the ancient <i>Vallis Sapinorum</i>, 2 m.
S. Philip determined to convert the estate into a second
Versailles. The palace was built between 1721 and 1723. Its
façade is fronted by a colonnade in which the pillars reach to the
roof. The state apartments contain some valuable 18th-century
furniture, but the famous collection of sculptures was removed
to Madrid in 1836, and is preserved there in the Museo del Prado.
At La Granja it is represented by facsimiles in plaster. The
collegiate church adjoining the palace dates from 1724, and contains
the tombs of Philip V. and his consort Isabella Farnese.
An artificial lake called El Mar, 4095 ft. above sea-level,
irrigates the gardens, which are imitated from those of Versailles,
and supplies water for the fountains. These, despite the antiquated
and sometimes tasteless style of their ornamentation,
are probably the finest in the world; it is noteworthy that,
owing to the high level of the lake, no pumps or other mechanism
are needed to supply pressure. There are twenty-six fountains
besides lakes and waterfalls. Among the most remarkable
are the group of &ldquo;Perseus, Andromeda and the Sea-Monster,&rdquo;
which sends up a jet of water 110 ft. high, the &ldquo;Fame,&rdquo; which
reaches 125 ft., and the very elaborate &ldquo;Baths of Diana.&rdquo; It
is of the last that Philip V. is said to have remarked, &ldquo;It has
cost me three millions and amused me three minutes.&rdquo; Most
of the fountains were made by order of Queen Isabella in 1727,
during the king&rsquo;s absence. The glass factory of San Ildefonso
was founded by Charles III.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It was in La Granja that Philip V. resigned the crown to his son
in January 1724, to resume it after his son&rsquo;s death seven months
later; that the treaties of 1777, 1778, 1796 and 1800 were signed
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spain</a></span>: <i>History</i>); that Ferdinand VII. summoned Don Carlos to
the throne in 1832, but was induced to alter the succession in favour
of his own infant daughter Isabella, thus involving Spain in civil
war; and that in 1836 a military revolt compelled the Queen-regent
Christina to restore the constitution of 1812.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAGRENÉE, LOUIS JEAN FRANÇOIS<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> (1724-1805), French
painter, was a pupil of Carle Vanloo. Born at Paris on the
30th of December 1724, in 1755 he became a member of the
Royal Academy, presenting as his diploma picture the &ldquo;Rape of
Deianira&rdquo; (Louvre). He visited St Petersburg at the call of the
empress Elizabeth, and on his return was named in 1781 director
of the French Academy at Rome; he there painted the &ldquo;Indian
Widow,&rdquo; one of his best-known works. In 1804 Napoleon
conferred on him the cross of the legion of honour, and on
the 19th of June 1805 he died in the Louvre, of which he was
honorary keeper.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LA GUAIRA<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">La Guayra</span> (sometimes <span class="sc">Laguaira</span>, &amp;c.),
a town and port of Venezuela, in the Federal district, 23 m.
by rail and 6½ m. in a direct line N. of Caracas. Pop. (1904,
estimate) 14,000. It is situated between a precipitous mountain
side and a broad, semicircular indentation of the coast line which
forms the roadstead of the port. The anchorage was long considered
one of the most dangerous on the Caribbean coast, and
landing was attended with much danger. The harbour has been
improved by the construction of a concrete breakwater running
out from the eastern shore line 2044 ft., built up from an extreme
depth of 46 ft. or from an average depth of 29½ ft., and rising
19½ ft. above sea-level. This encloses an area of 76½ acres,
having an average depth of nearly 28 ft. The harbour is further
improved by 1870 ft. of concrete quays and 1397 ft. of retaining
sea-wall, with several piers (three covered) projecting into deep
water. These works were executed by a British company,
known as the La Guaira Harbour Corporation, Ltd., and were
completed in 1891 at a cost of about one million sterling. The
concession is for 99 years and the additional charges which the
company is authorized to impose are necessarily heavy. These
improvements and the restrictions placed upon the direct trade
between West Indian ports and the Orinoco have greatly increased
the foreign trade of La Guaira, which in 1903 was 52% of that
of the four <i>puertos habilitados</i> of the republic. The shipping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
entries of that year numbered 217, of which 203 entered with
general cargo and 14 with coal exclusively. The exports included
152,625 bags coffee, 114,947 bags cacao and 152,891 hides.
For 1905-1906 the imports at La Guaira were valued officially
at £767,365 and the exports at £663,708. The city stands on
sloping ground stretching along the circular coast line with a
varying width of 130 to 330 ft. and having the appearance of
an amphitheatre. The port improvements added 18 acres of
reclaimed land to La Guaira&rsquo;s area, and the removal of old shore
batteries likewise increased its available breadth. In this narrow
space is built the town, composed in great part of small, roughly-made
cabins, and narrow, badly-paved streets, but with good
business houses on its principal street. From the mountain side,
reddish-brown in colour and bare of vegetation, the solar heat
is reflected with tremendous force, the mean annual temperature
being 84° F. The seaside towns of Maiquetia, 2 m. W. and
Macuto, 3 m. E., which have better climatic and sanitary
conditions and are connected by a narrow-gauge railway, are
the residences of many of the wealthier merchants of La Guaira.</p>

<p>La Guaira was founded in 1588, was sacked by filibusters
under Amias Preston in 1595, and by the French under Grammont
in 1680, was destroyed by the great earthquake of
the 26th of March 1812, and suffered severely in the war for
independence. In 1903, pending the settlement of claims of
Great Britain, Germany and Italy against Venezuela, La
Guaira was blockaded by a British-German-Italian fleet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA GUÉRONNIÈRE, LOUIS ÉTIENNE ARTHUR DUBREUIL HÉLION<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span>,
<span class="sc">Vicomte de</span> (1816-1875), French politician, was the
scion of a noble Poitevin family. Although by birth and education
attached to Legitimist principles, he became closely
associated with Lamartine, to whose organ, <i>Le Bien Public</i>, he
was a principal contributor. After the stoppage of this paper
he wrote for <i>La Presse</i>, and in 1850 edited <i>Le Pays</i>. A character
sketch of Louis Napoleon in this journal caused differences with
Lamartine, and La Guéronnière became more and more closely
identified with the policy of the prince president. Under the
Empire he was a member of the council of state (1853), senator
(1861), ambassador at Brussels (1868), and at Constantinople
(1870), and grand officer of the legion of honour (1866). He
died in Paris on the 23rd of December 1875. Besides his <i>Études
et portraits politiques contemporains</i> (1856) his most important
works are those on the foreign policy of the Empire: <i>La France,
Rome et Italie</i> (1851), <i>L&rsquo;Abandon de Rome</i> (1862), <i>De la politique
intérieure et extérieure de la France</i> (1862).</p>

<p>His elder brother, <span class="sc">Alfred Dubreuil Hélion</span>, Comte de La
Guéronnière (1810-1884), who remained faithful to the Legitimist
party, was also a well-known writer and journalist. He was consistent
in his opposition to the July Monarchy and the Empire,
but in a series of books on the crisis of 1870-1871 showed a
more favourable attitude to the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAGUERRE, JEAN HENRI GEORGES<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> (1858-&emsp;&emsp;), French
lawyer and politician, was born in Paris on the 24th of June
1858. Called to the bar in 1879, he distinguished himself by
brilliant pleadings in favour of socialist and anarchist leaders,
defending Prince Kropotkine at Lyons in 1883, Louise Michel
in the same year; and in 1886, with A. Millerand as colleague
he defended Ernest Roche and Duc Quercy, the instigators of
the Decazeville strike. His strictures on the <i>procureur de la
République</i> on this occasion being declared libellous he was suspended
for six months and in 1890 he again incurred suspension
for an attack on the attorney-general, Quesnay de Beaurepaire.
He also pleaded in the greatest criminal cases of his time, though
from 1893 onwards exclusively in the provinces, his exclusion
from the Parisian bar having been secured on the pretext of
his connexion with <i>La Presse</i>. He entered the Chamber of
Deputies for Apt in 1883 as a representative of the extreme
revisionist programme, and was one of the leaders of the
Boulangist agitation. He had formerly written for Georges
Clemenceau&rsquo;s organ <i>La Justice</i>, but when Clemenceau refused
to impose any shibboleth on the radical party he became director
of <i>La Presse</i>. He rallied to the republican party in May 1801,
some months before General Boulanger&rsquo;s suicide. He was not
re-elected to the Chamber in 1893. Laguerre was an excellent
lecturer on the revolutionary period of French history, concerning
which he had collected many valuable and rare documents.
He interested himself in the fate of the &ldquo;Little Dauphin&rdquo;
(Louis XVII.), whose supposed remains, buried at Ste Marguerite,
he proved to be those of a boy of fourteen.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAGUNA<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">La Laguna</span>, an episcopal city and formerly the
capital of the island of Teneriffe, in the Spanish archipelago
of the Canary Islands. Pop. (1900) 13,074. Laguna is 4 m. N.
by W. of Santa Cruz, in a plain 1800 ft. above sea-level, surrounded
by mountains. Snow is unknown here, and the mean
annual temperature exceeds 63° F.; but the rainfall is very
heavy, and in winter the plain is sometimes flooded. The
humidity of the atmosphere, combined with the warm climate
and rich volcanic soil, renders the district exceptionally fertile;
wheat, wine and tobacco, oranges and other fruits, are produced
in abundance. Laguna is the favourite summer residence of
the wealthier inhabitants of Santa Cruz. Besides the cathedral,
the city contains several picturesque convents, now secularized,
a fine modern town hall, hospitals, a large public library and
some ancient palaces of the Spanish nobility. Even the modern
buildings have often an appearance of antiquity, owing to the
decay caused by damp, and the luxuriant growth of climbing
plants.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LA HARPE, JEAN FRANÇOIS DE<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> (1739-1803), French critic,
was born in Paris of poor parents on the 20th of November
1739. His father, who signed himself Delharpe, was a descendant
of a noble family originally of Vaud. Left an orphan at the age
of nine, La Harpe was taken care of for six months by the sisters
of charity, and his education was provided for by a scholarship
at the Collège d&rsquo;Harcourt. When nineteen he was imprisoned
for some months on the charge of having written a satire against
his protectors at the college. La Harpe always denied his guilt,
but this culminating misfortune of an early life spent entirely
in the position of a dependent had possibly something to do
with the bitterness he evinced in later life. In 1763 his tragedy
of <i>Warwick</i> was played before the court. This, his first play,
was perhaps the best he ever wrote. The many authors whom he
afterwards offended were always able to observe that the critic&rsquo;s
own plays did not reach the standard of excellence he set up.
<i>Timoléon</i> (1764), <i>Pharamond</i> (1765) and <i>Gustave Wasa</i> (1766) were
failures. <i>Mélanie</i> was a better play, but was never represented.
The success of <i>Warwick</i> led to a correspondence with Voltaire,
who conceived a high opinion of La Harpe, even allowing him
to correct his verses. In 1764 La Harpe married the daughter
of a coffee house keeper. This marriage, which proved very
unhappy and was dissolved, did not improve his position.
They were very poor, and for some time were guests of Voltaire
at Ferney. When, after Voltaire&rsquo;s death, La Harpe in his praise
of the philosopher ventured on some reasonable, but rather
ill-timed, criticism of individual works, he was accused of treachery
to one who had been his constant friend. In 1768 he returned
from Ferney to Paris, where he began to write for the <i>Mercure</i>.
He was a born fighter and had small mercy on the authors whose
work he handled. But he was himself violently attacked, and
suffered under many epigrams, especially those of Lebrun-Pindare.
No more striking proof of the general hostility can be
given than his reception (1776) at the Academy, which Sainte-Beuve
calls his &ldquo;execution.&rdquo; Marmontel, who received him,
used the occasion to eulogize La Harpe&rsquo;s predecessor, Charles
Pierre Colardeau, especially for his pacific, modest and indulgent
disposition. The speech was punctuated by the applause of the
audience, who chose to regard it as a series of sarcasms on the
new member. Eventually La Harpe was compelled to resign
from the <i>Mercure</i>, which he had edited from 1770. On the
stage he produced <i>Les Barmécides</i> (1778), <i>Philoctète</i>, <i>Jeanne de
Naples</i> (1781), <i>Les Brames</i> (1783), <i>Coriolan</i> (1784), <i>Virginie</i>
(1786). In 1786 he began a course of literature at the newly-established
Lycée. In these lectures, published as the <i>Cours de
littérature ancienne et moderne</i>, La Harpe is at his best, for he
found a standpoint more or less independent of contemporary
polemics. He is said to be inexact in dealing with the ancients,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
and he had only a superficial knowledge of the middle ages, but he
is excellent in his analysis of 17th-century writers. Sainte-Beuve
found in him the best critic of the French school of tragedy, which
reached its perfection in Racine. La Harpe was a disciple of the
&ldquo;<i>philosophes</i>&rdquo;; he supported the extreme party through the
excesses of 1792 and 1793. In 1793 he edited the <i>Mercure de
France</i> which adhered blindly to the revolutionary leaders.
But in April 1794 he was nevertheless seized as a &ldquo;suspect.&rdquo;
In prison he underwent a spiritual crisis which he described in
convincing language, and he emerged an ardent Catholic and a
reactionist in politics. When he resumed his chair at the
Lycée, he attacked his former friends in politics and literature.
He was imprudent enough to begin the publication (1801-1807)
of his <i>Correspondance littéraire</i> (1774-1791) with the grand-duke,
afterwards the emperor Paul of Russia. In these letters he
surpassed the brutalities of the <i>Mercure</i>. He contracted a
second marriage, which was dissolved after a few weeks by his
wife. He died on the 11th of February 1803 in Paris, leaving
in his will an incongruous exhortation to his fellow countrymen
to maintain peace and concord. Among his posthumous works
was a <i>Prophétie de Cazotte</i> which Sainte-Beuve pronounces his
best work. It is a sombre description of a dinner-party of
notables long before the Revolution, when Jacques Cazotte
is made to prophesy the frightful fates awaiting the various
individuals of the company.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among his works not already mentioned are:&mdash;<i>Commentaire sur
Racine</i> (1795-1796), published in 1807; <i>Commentaire sur le théâtre de
Voltaire</i> of earlier date (published posthumously in 1814), and an epic
poem <i>La Religion</i> (1814). His <i>Cours de littérature</i> has been often
reprinted. To the edition of 1825-1826 is prefixed a notice by
Pierre Daunou. See also Sainte-Beuve, <i>Causeries du lundi</i>, vol. v.;

born at Paris on the 27th of February 1606. He became a
pupil of Lallemand, studied the works of Primaticcio at Fontainebleau,
but never visited Italy, and belongs wholly to that transition
period which preceded the school of Simon Vouet. His
picture of Nicolas V. opening the crypt in which he discovers
the corpse of St Francis of Assisi standing (Louvre) was executed
in 1630 for the Capuchins of the Marais; it shows a gravity
and sobriety of character which marked Lahire&rsquo;s best work, and
seems not to have been without influence on Le Sueur. The
Louvre contains eight other works, and paintings by Lahire are in
the museums of Strasburg, Rouen and Le Mans. His drawings,
of which the British Museum possesses a fine example, &ldquo;Presentation
of the Virgin in the Temple,&rdquo; are treated as seriously
as his paintings, and sometimes show simplicity and dignity
of effect. The example of the Capuchins, for whom he executed
several other works in Paris, Rouen and Fécamp, was followed
by the goldsmiths&rsquo; company, for whom he produced in 1635 &ldquo;St
Peter healing the Sick&rdquo; (Louvre) and the &ldquo;Conversion of St
Paul&rdquo; in 1637. In 1646, with eleven other artists, he founded
the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. Richelieu
called Lahire to the Palais Royal; Chancellor Séguier, Tallemant
de Réaux and many others entrusted him with important
works of decoration; for the Gobelins he designed a series of
large compositions. Lahire painted also a great number of
portraits, and in 1654 united in one work for the town-hall of
Paris those of the principal dignitaries of the municipality.
He died on the 28th of December 1656.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAHN<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span>, a river of Germany, a right-bank tributary of the
Rhine. Its source is on the Jagdberg, a summit of the Rothaar
Mountains, in the cellar of a house (Lahnhof), at an elevation
of 1975 ft. It flows at first eastward and then southward to
Giessen, then turns south-westward and with a winding course
reaches the Rhine between the towns of Oberlahnstein and
Niederlahnstein. Its valley, the lower part of which divides
the Taunus hills from the Westerwald, is often very narrow and
picturesque; among the towns and sites of interest on its banks
are Marburg and Giessen with their universities, Wetzlar with
its cathedral, Runkel with its castle, Limburg with its cathedral,
the castles of Schaumburg, Balduinstein, Laurenburg, Langenau,
Burgstein and Nassau, and the well-known health resort of Ems.
The Lahn is about 135 m. long; it is navigable from its mouth
to Giessen, and is partly canalized. A railway follows the valley
practically throughout. In 1796 there were here several encounters
between the French under General Jourdan and the
troops of the archduke Johan, which resulted in the retreat of
the French across the Rhine.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAHNDA<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> (properly <i>Lahnd&#257;</i> or <i>Lahind&#257;</i>, western, or <i>Lahnd&#275;-d&#299;
b&#333;l&#299;</i>, the language of the West), an Indo-Aryan language spoken
in the western Punjab. In 1901 the number of speakers was
3,337,917. Its eastern boundary is very indefinite as the language
gradually merges into the Panjabi immediately to the east, but
it is conventionally taken as the river Chenab from the Kashmir
frontier to the town of Ramnagar, and thence as a straight line
to the south-west corner of the district of Montgomery. Lahnda
is also spoken in the north of the state of Bahawalpur and of the
province of Sind, in which latter locality it is known as Siraiki.
Its western boundary is, roughly speaking, the river Indus,
across which the language of the Afghan population is Pashto
(Pushtu), while the Hindu settlers still speak Lahnda. In the
Derajat, however, Lahnda is the principal language of all classes
in the plains west of the river.</p>

<p>Lahnda is also known as Western Panjabi and as Jatki, or
the language of the Jats, who form the bulk of the population
whose mother-tongue it is. In the Derajat it is called Hindko
or the language of Hindus. In 1819 the Serampur missionaries
published a Lahnda version of the New Testament. They
called the language Uchch&#299;, from the important town of Uch
near the confluence of the Jhelam and the Chenab. This name
is commonly met with in old writings. It has numerous dialects,
which fall into two main groups, a northern and a southern,
the speakers of which are separated by the Salt Range. The
principal varieties of the northern group are Hindki (the same
in meaning as Hindko) and P&#333;thw&#257;r&#299;. In the southern group
the most important are Kh&#275;tr&#257;n&#299;, Mult&#257;n&#299;, and the dialect of
Shahpur. The language possesses no literature.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lahnda belongs to the north-western group of the outer band of
Indo-Aryan languages (<i>q.v.</i>), the other members being Kashmiri
(<i>q.v.</i>) and Sindhi, with both of which it is closely connected. See

<p><span class="bold">LA HOGUE, BATTLE OF<a name="ar142" id="ar142"></a></span>, the name now given to a series of
encounters which took place from the 19th to the 23rd (O.S.)
of May 1692, between an allied British and Dutch fleet and a
French force, on the northern and eastern sides of the Cotentin
in Normandy. A body of French troops, and a number of
Jacobite exiles, had been collected in the Cotentin. The
government of Louis XIV. prepared a naval armament to cover
their passage across the Channel. This force was to have been
composed of the French ships at Brest commanded by the count
of Tourville, and of a squadron which was to have joined him
from Toulon. But the Toulon ships were scattered by a gale,
and the combination was not effected. The count of Tourville,
who had put to sea to meet them, had with him only 45 or
47 ships of the line. Yet when the reinforcement failed to
join him, he steered up Channel to meet the allies, who were
known to be in strength. On the 15th of May the British fleet
of 63 sail of the line, under command of Edward Russell, afterwards
earl of Orford, was joined at St Helens by the Dutch
squadron of 36 sail under Admiral van Allemonde. The apparent
rashness of the French admiral in seeking an encounter with
very superior numbers is explained by the existence of a general
belief that many British captains were discontented, and would
pass over from the service of the government established by
the Revolution of 1688 to their exiled king, James II. It is said
that Tourville had orders from Louis XIV. to attack in any case,
but the story is of doubtful authority. The British government,
aware of the Jacobite intrigues in its fleet, and of the prevalence
of discontent, took the bold course of appealing to the loyalty
and patriotism of its officers. At a meeting of the flag-officers on
board the &ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; Russell&rsquo;s flag-ship, on the 15th of May,
they protested their loyalty, and the whole allied fleet put to sea
on the 18th. On the 19th of May, when Cape Barfleur, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
north-eastern point of the Cotentin, was 21 m. S.W. of them,
they sighted Tourville, who was then 20 m. to the north of Cape
La Hague, the north-western extremity of the peninsula, which
must not be confounded with La Houque, or La Hogue, the
place at which the fighting ended. The allies were formed in a
line from S.S.W. to N.N.E. heading towards the English coast,
the Dutch forming the White or van division, while the Red or
centre division under Russell, and the Blue or rear under Sir
John Ashby, were wholly composed of British ships. The wind
was from the S.W. and the weather hazy. Tourville bore down
and attacked about mid-day, directing his main assault on the
centre of the allies, but telling off some ships to watch the van
and rear of his enemy. As this first encounter took place off Cape
Barfleur, the battle was formerly often called by the name. On
the centre, where Tourville was directly opposed to Russell, the
fighting was severe. The British flag-ship the &ldquo;Britannia&rdquo;
(100), and the French, the &ldquo;Soleil Royal&rdquo; (100), were both
completely crippled. After several hours of conflict, the French
admiral, seeing himself outnumbered, and that the allies could
outflank him and pass through the necessarily wide intervals
in his extended line, drew off without the loss of a ship. The
wind now fell and the haze became a fog. Till the 23rd, the two
fleets remained off the north coast of the Cotentin, drifting
west with the ebb tide or east with the flood, save when they
anchored. During the night of the 19th/20th some British ships
became entangled, in the fog, with the French, and drifted
through them on the tide, with loss. On the 23rd both fleets
were near La Hague. About half the French, under D&rsquo;Amfreville,
rounded the cape, and fled to St Malo through the dangerous
passage known as the Race of Alderney (le Ras Blanchard).
The others were unable to get round the cape before the flood tide
set in, and were carried to the eastward. Tourville now transferred
his own flag, and left his captains free to save themselves
as they best could. He left the &ldquo;Soleil Royal,&rdquo; and sent her
with two others to Cherbourg, where they were destroyed by Sir
Ralph Delaval. The others now ran round Cape Barfleur, and
sought refuge on the east side of the Cotentin at the anchorage
of La Houque, called by the English La Hogue, where the troops
destined for the invasion were encamped. Here 13 of them
were burnt by Sir George Rooke, in the presence of the French
generals and of the exiled king James II. From the name of
the place where the last blow was struck, the battle has come
to be known by the name of La Hogue.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Sufficient accounts of the battle may be found in Lediard&rsquo;s <i>Naval
History</i> (London, 1735), and for the French side in Tronde&rsquo;s <i>Batailles
navales de la France</i> (Paris, 1867). The escape of D&rsquo;Amfreville&rsquo;s
squadron is the subject of Browning&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Hervé Riel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAHORE,<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> an ancient city of British India, the capital of the
Punjab, which gives its name to a district and division. It lies
in 31° 35&prime; N. and 74° 20&prime; E. near the left bank of the River Ravi,
1706 ft. above the sea, and 1252 m. by rail from Calcutta.
It is thus in about the same latitude as Cairo, but owing to its
inland position is considerably hotter than that city, being one
of the hottest places in India in the summer time. In the cold
season the climate is pleasantly cool and bright. The native
city is walled, about 1¼ m. in length W. to E. and about ¾ m.
in breadth N. to S. Its site has been occupied from early times,
and much of it stands high above the level of the surrounding
country, raised on the remains of a succession of former habitations.
Some old buildings, which have been preserved, stand
now below the present surface of the ground. This is well seen
in the mosque now called Masjid Niwin (or sunken) built in
1560, the mosque of Mullah Rahmat, 7 ft. below, and the Shivali,
a very old Hindu temple, about 12 ft. below the surrounding
ground. Hindu tradition traces the origin of Lahore to Loh
or Lava, son of Rama, the hero of the <i>Ramayana</i>. The absence
of mention of Lahore by Alexander&rsquo;s historians, and the fact
that coins of the Graeco-Bactrian kings are not found among
the ruins, lead to the belief that it was not a place of any importance
during the earliest period of Indian history. On the other
hand, Hsüan Tsang, the Chinese Buddhist, notices the city in
his <i>Itinerary</i> (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 630); and it seems probable, therefore, that
Lahore first rose into prominence between the 1st and 7th
centuries <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Governed originally by a family of Chauhan
Rajputs, a branch of the house of Ajmere, Lahore fell successively
under the dominion of the Ghazni and Ghori sultans, who made
it the capital of their Indian conquests, and adorned it with
numerous buildings, almost all now in ruins. But it was under
the Mogul empire that Lahore reached its greatest size and
magnificence. The reigns of Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah
Jahan and Aurangzeb form the golden period in the annals and
architecture of the city. Akbar enlarged and repaired the fort,
and surrounded the town with a wall, portions of which remain,
built into the modern work of Ranjit Singh. Lahore formed the
capital of the Sikh empire of that monarch. At the end of the
second Sikh War, with the rest of the Punjab, it came under
the British dominion.</p>

<p>The architecture of Lahore cannot compare with that of
Delhi. Jahangir in 1622-1627 erected the Khwabgah or &ldquo;sleeping-place,&rdquo;
a fine palace much defaced by the Sikhs but to some
extent restored in modern times; the Moti Masjid or &ldquo;pearl
mosque&rdquo; in the fort, used by Ranjit Singh and afterwards by
the British as a treasure-house; and also the tomb of Anarkali,
used formerly as the station church and now as a library. Shah
Jahan erected a palace and other buildings near the Khwabgah,
including the beautiful pavilion called the Naulakha from its
cost of nine lakhs, which was inlaid with precious stones. The
mosque of Wazir Khan (1634) provides the finest example of
<i>kashi</i> or encaustic tile work. Aurangzeb&rsquo;s Jama Masjid, or
&ldquo;great mosque,&rdquo; is a huge bare building, stiff in design, and
lacking the detailed ornament typical of buildings at Delhi.
The buildings of Ranjit Singh, especially his mausoleum, are
common and meretricious in style. He was, moreover, responsible
for much of the despoiling of the earlier buildings. The streets
of the native city are narrow and tortuous, and are best seen
from the back of an elephant. Two of the chief features of
Lahore lie outside its walls at Shahdara and Shalamar Gardens
respectively. Shahdara, which contains the tomb of the emperor
Jahangir, lies across the Ravi some 6 m. N. of the city. It
consists of a splendid marble cenotaph surrounded by a grove
of trees and gardens. The Shalamar Gardens, which were laid
out in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1637 by Shah Jahan, lie 6 m. E. of the city. They
are somewhat neglected except on festive occasions, when the
fountains are playing and the trees are lit up by lamps at
night.</p>

<p>The modern city of Lahore, which contained a population
of 202,964 in 1901, may be divided into four parts: the native
city, already described; the civil station or European quarter,
known as Donald Town; the Anarkali bazaar, a suburb S. of
the city wall; and the cantonment, formerly called Mian Mir.
The main street of the civil station is a portion of the grand
trunk road from Calcutta to Peshawar, locally known as the
Mall. The chief modern buildings along this road, west to east,
are the Lahore museum, containing a fine collection of Graeco-Buddhist
sculptures, found by General Cunningham in the
Yusufzai country, and arranged by Mr Lockwood Kipling, a
former curator of the museum; the cathedral, begun by Bishop
French, in Early English style, and consecrated in 1887; the
Lawrence Gardens and Montgomery Halls, surrounded by a
garden that forms the chief meeting-place of Europeans in the
afternoon; and opposite this government house, the official
residence of the lieutenant-governor of the Punjab; next to
this is the Punjab club for military men and civilians. Three
miles beyond is the Lahore cantonment, where the garrison is
stationed, except a company of British infantry, which occupies
the fort. It is the headquarters of the 3rd division of the northern
army. Lahore is an important junction on the North-Western
railway system, but has little local trade or manufacture. The
chief industries are silk goods, gold and silver lace, metal work
and carpets which are made in the Lahore gaol. There are also
cotton mills, flour mills, an ice-factory, and several factories
for mineral waters, oils, soap, leather goods, &amp;c. Lahore is
an important educational centre. Here are the Punjab University
with five colleges, medical and law colleges, a central training
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
college, the Aitchison Chiefs&rsquo; College for the sons of native
noblemen, and a number of other high schools and technical
and special schools.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">District of Lahore</span> has an area of 3704 sq. m., and its
population in 1901 was 1,162,109, consisting chiefly of Punjabi
Mahommedans with a large admixture of Hindus and Sikhs.
In the north-west the district includes a large part of the barren
Rechna Doab, while south of the Ravi is a desolate alluvial
tract, liable to floods. The Manjha plateau, however, between
the Ravi and the Beas, has been rendered fertile by the Bari
Doab canal. The principal crops are wheat, pulse, millets,
maize, oil-seeds and cotton. There are numerous factories for
ginning and pressing cotton. Irrigation is provided by the main
line of the Bari Doab canal and its branches, and by inundation-cuts
from the Sutlej. The district is crossed in several directions
by lines of the North-Western railway. Lahore, Kasur, Chunian
and Raiwind are the chief trade centres.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Division of Lahore</span> extends along the right bank of
the Sutlej from the Himalayas to Multan. It comprises the six
districts of Sialkot, Gujranwala, Montgomery, Lahore, Amritsar
and Gurdaspur. Total area, 17,154 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 5,598,463.
The commissioner for the division also exercises political control
over the hill slate of Chamba. The common language of the
rural population and of artisans is Punjabi; while Urdu or
Hindustani is spoken by the educated classes. So far from the
seaboard, the range between extremes of winter and summer
temperature in the sub-tropics is great. The mean temperature
in the shade in June is about 92° F., in January about 50°. In
midsummer the thermometer sometimes rises to 115° in the
shade, and remains on some occasions as high as 105° throughout
the night. In winter the morning temperature is sometimes
as low as 20°. The rainfall is uncertain, ranging from 8 in. to
25, with an average of 15 in. The country as a whole is parched
and arid, and greatly dependent on irrigation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA HOZ Y MOTA, JUAN CLAUDIO DE<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (1630?-1710?),
Spanish dramatist, was born in Madrid. He became a knight
of Santiago in 1653, and soon afterwards succeeded his father
as <i>regidor</i> of Burgos. In 1665 he was nominated to an important
post at the Treasury, and in his later years acted as official
censor of the Madrid theatres. On the 13th of August 1709
he signed his play entitled <i>Josef, salvador de Egipto</i>, and is presumed
to have died in the following year. Hoz is not remarkable
for originality of conception, but his recasts of plays by
earlier writers are distinguished by an adroitness which accounts
for the esteem in which he was held by his contemporaries.

duchy of Carniola, 237 m. S.S.W. of Vienna by rail. Pop. (1900)
36,547, mostly Slovene. It is situated on the Laibach, near its
influx into the Save, and consists of the town proper and eight
suburbs. Laibach is an episcopal see, and possesses a cathedral
in the Italian style, several beautiful churches, a town hall in
Renaissance style and a castle, built in the 15th century, on the
Schlossberg, an eminence which commands the town. Laibach
is the principal centre of the national Slovenian movement,
and it contains a Slovene theatre and several societies for the
promotion of science and literature in the native tongue. The
Slovenian language is in general official use, and the municipal
administration is purely Slovenian. The industries include
manufactures of pottery, bricks, oil, linen and woollen cloth,
fire-hose and paper.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Laibach is supposed to occupy the site of the ancient Emona or
Aemona, founded by the emperor Augustus in 34 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> It was
besieged by Alaric in 400, and in 451 it was desolated by the Huns.
In 900 Laibach suffered much from the Magyars, who were, however,
defeated there in 914. In the 12th century the town passed into the
hands of the dukes of Carinthia; in 1270 it was taken by Ottocar of
Bohemia; and in 1277 it came under the Habsburgs. In the early
part of the 15th century the town was several times besieged by the
Turks. The bishopric was founded in 1461. On the 17th of March
1797 and again on the 3rd of June 1809 Laibach was taken by the
French, and from 1809 to 1813 it became the seat of their general
government of the Illyrian provinces. From 1816 to 1849 Laibach
was the capital of the kingdom of Illyria. The town is also historically
known from the congress of Laibach, which assembled here in
1821 (see below). Laibach suffered severely on the 14th of April
1895 from an earthquake.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Congress or Conference of Laibach.</i>&mdash;Before the break-up of
the conference of Troppau (<i>q.v.</i>), it had been decided to adjourn
it till the following January, and to invite the attendance of
the king of Naples, Laibach being chosen as the place of meeting.
Castlereagh, in the name of Great Britain, had cordially
approved this invitation, as &ldquo;implying negotiation&rdquo; and therefore
as a retreat from the position taken up in the Troppau
Protocol. Before leaving Troppau, however, the three autocratic
powers, Russia, Austria and Prussia, had issued, on the 8th of
December 1820, a circular letter, in which they reiterated the
principles of the Protocol, <i>i.e.</i> the right and duty of the powers
responsible for the peace of Europe to intervene to suppress
any revolutionary movement by which they might conceive
that peace to be endangered (Hertslet, No. 105). Against this
view Castlereagh once more protested in a circular despatch of
the 19th of January 1821, in which he clearly differentiated
between the objectionable general principles advanced by the
three powers, and the particular case of the unrest in Italy,
the immediate concern not of Europe at large, but of Austria
and of any other Italian powers which might consider themselves
endangered (Hertslet, No. 107).</p>

<p>The conference opened on the 26th of January 1821, and its
constitution emphasized the divergences revealed in the above
circulars. The emperors of Russia and Austria were present
in person, and with them were Counts Nesselrode and Capo
d&rsquo;Istria, Metternich and Baron Vincent; Prussia and France
were represented by plenipotentiaries. But Great Britain, on
the ground that she had no immediate interest in the Italian
question, was represented only by Lord Stewart, the ambassador
at Vienna, who was not armed with full powers, his mission being
to watch the proceedings and to see that nothing was done
beyond or in violation of the treaties. Of the Italian princes,
Ferdinand of Naples and the duke of Modena came in person;
the rest were represented by plenipotentiaries.</p>

<p>It was soon clear that a more or less open breach between
Great Britain and the other powers was inevitable, Metternich
was anxious to secure an apparent unanimity of the powers to
back the Austrian intervention in Naples, and every device
was used to entrap the English representative into subscribing
a formula which would have seemed to commit Great Britain
to the principles of the other allies. When these devices failed,
attempts were made unsuccessfully to exclude Lord Stewart
from the conferences on the ground of defective powers. Finally
he was forced to an open protest, which he caused to be inscribed
on the journals, but the action of Capo d&rsquo;Istria in reading to the
assembled Italian ministers, who were by no means reconciled
to the large claims implied in the Austrian intervention, a declaration
in which as the result of the &ldquo;intimate union established
by solemn acts between all the European powers&rdquo; the Russian
emperor offered to the allies &ldquo;the aid of his arms, should new
revolutions threaten new dangers,&rdquo; an attempt to revive that
idea of a &ldquo;universal union&rdquo; based on the Holy Alliance (<i>q.v.</i>)
against which Great Britain had consistently protested.</p>

<p>The objections of Great Britain were, however, not so much
to an Austrian intervention in Naples as to the far-reaching
principles by which it was sought to justify it. King Ferdinand
had been invited to Laibach, according to the circular of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
8th of December, in order that he might be free to act as
&ldquo;mediator between his erring peoples and the states whose
tranquillity they threatened.&rdquo; The cynical use he made of his
&ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to repudiate obligations solemnly contracted is
described elsewhere (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Naples</a></span>, <i>History</i>). The result of this
action was the Neapolitan declaration of war and the occupation
of Naples by Austria, with the sanction of the congress.
This was preceded, on the 10th of March, by the revolt of the
garrison of Alessandria and the military revolution in Piedmont,
which in its turn was suppressed, as a result of negotiations at
Laibach, by Austrian troops. It was at Laibach, too, that, on
the 19th of March, the emperor Alexander received the news
of Ypsilanti&rsquo;s invasion of the Danubian principalities, which
heralded the outbreak of the War of Greek Independence, and
from Laibach Capo d&rsquo;Istria addressed to the Greek leader the
tsar&rsquo;s repudiation of his action.</p>

<p>The conference closed on the 12th of May, on which date
Russia, Austria and Prussia issued a declaration (Hertslet,
No. 108) &ldquo;to proclaim to the world the principles which guided
them&rdquo; in coming &ldquo;to the assistance of subdued peoples,&rdquo; a
declaration which once more affirmed the principles of the
Troppau Protocol. In this lay the European significance of the
Laibach conference, of which the activities had been mainly
confined to Italy. The issue of the declaration without the
signatures of the representatives of Great Britain and France
proclaimed the disunion of the alliance, within which&mdash;to use
Lord Stewart&rsquo;s words&mdash;there existed &ldquo;a triple understanding
which bound the parties to carry forward their own views in
spite of any difference of opinion between them and the two
great constitutional governments.&rdquo;</p>

an elementary education in Peebles he returned to work upon
his father&rsquo;s farm. James Hogg, the shepherd poet, who was

<p><span class="bold">LAING, ALEXANDER GORDON<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> (1793-1826), Scottish
explorer, the first European to reach Timbuktu, was born at
Edinburgh on the 27th of December 1793. He was educated
by his father, William Laing, a private teacher of classics, and
at Edinburgh University. In 1811 he went to Barbados as
clerk to his maternal uncle Colonel (afterwards General) Gabriel
Gordon. Through General Sir George Beckwith, governor of
Barbados, he obtained an ensigncy in the York Light Infantry.
He was employed in the West Indies, and in 1822 was promoted
to a company in the Royal African Corps. In that year, while
with his regiment at Sierra Leone, he was sent by the governor,
Sir Charles MacCarthy, to the Mandingo country, with the double
object of opening up commerce and endeavouring to abolish the
slave trade in that region. Later in the same year Laing visited
Falaba, the capital of the Sulima country, and ascertained the
source of the Rokell. He endeavoured to reach the source of
the Niger, but was stopped by the natives. He was, however,
enabled to fix it with approximate accuracy. He took an active
part in the Ashanti War of 1823-24, and was sent home with the
despatches containing the news of the death in action of Sir
Charles MacCarthy. Henry, 3rd Earl Bathurst, then secretary
for the colonies, instructed Captain Laing to undertake a journey,
via Tripoli and Timbuktu, to further elucidate the hydrography
of the Niger basin. Laing left England in February 1825, and at
Tripoli on the 14th of July following he married Emma Warrington,
daughter of the British consul. Two days later, leaving his
bride behind, he started to cross the Sahara, being accompanied
by a sheikh who was subsequently accused of planning his
murder. Ghadames was reached, by an indirect route, in
October 1825, and in December Laing was in the Tuat territory,
where he was well received by the Tuareg. On the 10th of
January 1826 he left Tuat, and made for Timbuktu across the
desert of Tanezroft. Letters from him written in May and
July following told of sufferings from fever and the plundering
of his caravan by Tuareg, Laing being wounded in twenty-four
places in the fighting. Another letter dated from Timbuktu
on the 21st of September announced his arrival in that city on
the preceding 18th of August, and the insecurity of his position
owing to the hostility of the Fula chieftain Bello, then ruling
the city. He added that he intended leaving Timbuktu in
three days&rsquo; time. No further news was received from the
traveller. From native information it was ascertained that he
left Timbuktu on the day he had planned and was murdered
on the night of the 26th of September 1826. His papers were
never recovered, though it is believed that they were secretly
brought to Tripoli in 1828. In 1903 the French government
placed a tablet bearing the name of the explorer and the date of
his visit on the house occupied by him during his thirty-eight
days&rsquo; stay in Timbuktu.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p><span class="bold">LAING, DAVID<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> (1793-1878), Scottish antiquary, the son of
William Laing, a bookseller in Edinburgh, was born in that city
on the 20th of April 1793. Educated at the Canongate Grammar
School, when fourteen he was apprenticed to his father. Shortly
after the death of the latter in 1837, Laing was elected to the
librarianship of the Signet Library, which post he retained till
his death. Apart from an extraordinary general bibliographical
knowledge, Laing was best known as a lifelong student of the
literary and artistic history of Scotland. He published no
original volumes, but contented himself with editing the works
of others. Of these, the chief are&mdash;<i>Dunbar&rsquo;s Works</i> (2 vols.,
1834), with a supplement added in 1865; <i>Robert Baillie&rsquo;s
Letters and Journals</i> (3 vols., 1841-1842); <i>John Knox&rsquo;s Works</i>
(6 vols., 1846-1864); <i>Poems and Fables of Robert Henryson</i>
(1865); <i>Andrew of Wyntoun&rsquo;s Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland</i>
(3 vols., 1872-1879); <i>Sir David Lyndsay&rsquo;s Poetical Works</i>
(3 vols., 1879). Laing was for more than fifty years a member
of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and he contributed
upwards of a hundred separate papers to their <i>Proceedings</i>.
He was also for more than forty years secretary to the Bannatyne
Club, many of the publications of which were edited by him.
He was struck with paralysis in 1878 while in the Signet Library,
and it is related that, on recovering consciousness, he looked
about and asked if a proof of Wyntoun had been sent from the
printers. He died a few days afterwards, on the 18th of October,
in his eighty-sixth year. His library was sold by auction, and
realized £16,137. To the university of Edinburgh he bequeathed
his collection of MSS.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAING, MALCOLM<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (1762-1818), Scottish historian, son of
Robert Laing, and elder brother of Samuel Laing the elder,
was born on his paternal estate on the Mainland of Orkney.
Having studied at the grammar school of Kirkwall and at
Edinburgh University, he was called to the Scotch bar in 1785,
but devoted his time mainly to historical studies. In 1793 he
completed the sixth and last volume of Robert Henry&rsquo;s <i>History
of Great Britain</i>, the portion which he wrote being in its strongly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
liberal tone at variance with the preceding part of the work;
and in 1802 he published his <i>History of Scotland from the Union of
the Crowns to the Union of the Kingdoms</i>, a work showing considerable
research. Attached to the <i>History</i> was a dissertation on
the Gowrie conspiracy, and another on the supposed authenticity
of Ossian&rsquo;s poems. In another dissertation, prefixed to a second
and corrected edition of the <i>History</i> published in 1804, Laing
endeavoured to prove that Mary, queen of Scots, wrote the
Casket Letters, and was partly responsible for the murder of
Lord Darnley. In the same year he edited the <i>Life and Historie
of King James VI.</i>, and in 1805 brought out in two volumes an
edition of Ossian&rsquo;s poems. Laing, who was a friend of Charles
James Fox, was member of parliament for Orkney and Shetland
from 1807 to 1812. He died on the 6th of November 1818.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAING, SAMUEL<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> (1810-1897), British author and railway
administrator, was born at Edinburgh on the 12th of December
1810. He was the nephew of Malcolm Laing, the historian of
Scotland; and his father, Samuel Laing (1780-1868), was also
a well-known author, whose books on Norway and Sweden
attracted much attention. Samuel Laing the younger entered
St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, in 1827, and after graduating as
second wrangler and Smith&rsquo;s prizeman, was elected a fellow,
and remained at Cambridge temporarily as a coach. He was
called to the bar in 1837, and became private secretary to Mr
Labouchere (afterwards Lord Taunton), the president of the
Board of Trade. In 1842 he was made secretary to the railway
department, and retained this post till 1847. He had by then
become an authority on railway working, and had been a member
of the Dalhousie Railway Commission; it was at his suggestion
that the &ldquo;parliamentary&rdquo; rate of a penny a mile was instituted.
In 1848 he was appointed chairman and managing director of
the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway, and his business
faculty showed itself in the largely increased prosperity of the
line. He also became chairman (1852) of the Crystal Palace
Company, but retired from both posts in 1855. In 1852 he
entered parliament as a Liberal for Wick, and after losing his
seat in 1857, was re-elected in 1859, in which year he was appointed
financial secretary to the Treasury; in 1860 he was
made finance minister in India. On returning from India, he
was re-elected to parliament for Wick in 1865. He was defeated
in 1868, but in 1873 he was returned for Orkney and Shetland,
and retained his seat till 1885. Meanwhile he had been reappointed
chairman of the Brighton line in 1867, and continued
in that post till 1894, being generally recognized as an admirable
administrator. He was also chairman of the Railway Debenture
Trust and the Railway Share Trust. In later life he became
well known as an author, his <i>Modern Science and Modern
Thought</i> (1885), <i>Problems of the Future</i> (1889) and <i>Human
Origins</i> (1892) being widely read, not only by reason of the
writer&rsquo;s influential position, experience of affairs and clear
style, but also through their popular and at the same time
well-informed treatment of the scientific problems of the day.
Laing died at Sydenham on the 6th of August 1897.</p>

from Majuba to the Buffalo river, and before the opening of
the railway in 1891 the road over the nek was the main artery
of communication between Durban and Pretoria. The railway
pierces the nek by a tunnel 2213 ft. long. When the Boers
rose in revolt in December 1880 they occupied Laing&rsquo;s Nek
to oppose the entry of British reinforcements into the Transvaal.
On the 28th of January 1881 a small British force endeavoured
to drive the Boers from the pass, but was forced to retire.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAIRD, MACGREGOR<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span> (1808-1861), Scottish merchant,
pioneer of British trade on the Niger, was born at Greenock in
1808, the younger son of William Laird, founder of the Birkenhead
firm of shipbuilders of that name. In 1831 Laird and
certain Liverpool merchants formed a company for the commercial
development of the Niger regions, the lower course of the Niger
having been made known that year by Richard and John Lander.
In 1832 the company despatched two small ships to the Niger,
one, the &ldquo;Alburkah,&rdquo; a paddle-wheel steamer of 55 tons designed
by Laird, being the first iron vessel to make an ocean voyage.
Macgregor Laird went with the expedition, which was led by
Richard Lander and numbered forty-eight Europeans, of whom
all but nine died from fever or, in the case of Lander, from
wounds. Laird went up the Niger to the confluence of the
Benue (then called the Shary or Tchadda), which he was the
first white man to ascend. He did not go far up the river but
formed an accurate idea as to its source and course. The expedition
returned to Liverpool in 1834, Laird and Surgeon R. A. K.
Oldfield being the only surviving officers besides Captain (then
Lieut.) William Allen, R.N., who accompanied the expedition
by order of the Admiralty to survey the river. Laird and
Oldfield published in 1837 in two volumes the <i>Narrative of an
Expedition into the Interior of Africa by the River Niger ... in
1832, 1833, 1834</i>. Commercially the expedition had been
unsuccessful, but Laird had gained experience invaluable to
his successors. He never returned to Africa but henceforth
devoted himself largely to the development of trade with West
Africa and especially to the opening up of the countries now
forming the British protectorates of Nigeria. One of his principal
reasons for so doing was his belief that this method was the best
means of stopping the slave trade and raising the social condition
of the Africans. In 1854 he sent out at his own charges, but with
the support of the British government, a small steamer, the
&ldquo;Pleiad,&rdquo; which under W. B. Baikie made so successful a voyage
that Laird induced the government to sign contracts for annual
trading trips by steamers specially built for navigation of the
Niger and Benue. Various stations were founded on the Niger,
and though government support was withdrawn after the death
of Laird and Baikie, British traders continued to frequent the
river, which Laird had opened up with little or no personal
advantage. Laird&rsquo;s interests were not, however, wholly African.
In 1837 he was one of the promoters of a company formed to
run steamships between England and New York, and in 1838
the &ldquo;Sirius,&rdquo; sent out by this company, was the first ship to
cross the Atlantic from Europe entirely under steam. Laird
died in London on the 9th of January 1861.</p>

<p>His elder brother, <span class="sc">John Laird</span> (1805-1874), was one of the first
to use iron in the construction of ships; in 1829 he made an
iron lighter of 60 tons which was used on canals and lakes in
Ireland; in 1834 he built the paddle steamer &ldquo;John Randolph&rdquo;
for Savannah, U.S.A., stated to be the first iron ship seen in
America. For the East India Company he built in 1839 the first
iron vessel carrying guns and he was also the designer of the
famous &ldquo;Birkenhead.&rdquo; A Conservative in politics, he represented
Birkenhead in the House of Commons from 1861 to his
death.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAÏS,<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> the name of two Greek courtesans, generally distinguished
as follows. (1) The elder, a native of Corinth, born
<i>c.</i> 480 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, was famous for her greed and hardheartedness, which
gained her the nickname of <i>Axin&#275;</i> (the axe). Among her lovers
were the philosophers Aristippus and Diogenes, and Eubatas
(or Aristoteles) of Cyrene, a famous runner. In her old age
she became a drunkard. Her grave was shown in the Craneion
near Corinth, surmounted by a lioness tearing a ram. (2) The
younger, daughter of Timandra the mistress of Alcibiades, born
at Hyccara in Sicily <i>c.</i> 420 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, taken to Corinth during the
Sicilian expedition. The painter Apelles, who saw her drawing
water from the fountain of Peirene, was struck by her beauty,
and took her as a model. Having followed a handsome Thessalian
to his native land, she was slain in the temple of Aphrodite by
women who were jealous of her beauty. Many anecdotes are
told of a Laïs by Athenaeus, Aelian, Pausanias, and she forms
the subject of many epigrams in the Greek Anthology; but,
owing to the similarity of names, there is considerable uncertainty
to whom they refer. The name itself, like Phryne, was used
as a general term for a courtesan.</p>

in Corsica and in Algeria in 1873. In 1876 he resigned his
commission to enter the Chamber as deputy for Nantes in the
republican interest, and in 1879 he became director of the <i>Petit
Parisien</i>. For alleged libel on General Courtot de Cissey in this
paper he was heavily fined. In the Chamber he spoke chiefly
on army questions; and was chairman of a commission appointed
to consider army legislation, resigning in 1887 on the refusal
of the Chamber to sanction the abolition of exemptions of any
kind. He then became an adherent of the revisionist policy
of General Boulanger and a member of the League of Patriots.
He was elected Boulangist deputy for the 18th Parisian arrondissement
in 1889. He did not seek re-election in 1893, but
devoted himself thenceforward to mathematics, helping to make
known in France the theories of Giusto Bellavitis. He was

<p><span class="bold">LAKANAL, JOSEPH<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> (1762-1845), French politician, was born
at Serres (Ariège) on the 14th of July 1762. His name, originally
Lacanal, was altered to distinguish him from his Royalist
brothers. He joined one of the teaching congregations, and for
fourteen years taught in their schools. When elected by his
native department to the Convention in 1792 he was acting
as vicar to his uncle Bernard Font (1723-1800), the constitutional
bishop of Pamiers. In the Convention he held apart from the
various party sections, although he voted for the death of
Louis XVI. He rendered great service to the Revolution by
his practical knowledge of education. He became a member
of the Committee of Public Instruction early in 1793, and after
carrying many useful decrees on the preservation of national
monuments, on the military schools, on the reorganization
of the Museum of Natural History and other matters, he brought
forward on the 26th of June his <i>Projet d&rsquo;éducation nationale</i>
(printed at the Imprimerie Nationale), which proposed to lay
the burden or primary education on the public funds, but to
leave secondary education to private enterprise. Provision was
also made for public festivals, and a central commission was to
be entrusted with educational questions. The scheme, in the
main the work of Sieyès, was refused by the Convention, who
submitted the whole question to a special commission of six,
which under the influence of Robespierre adopted a report
by Michel le Peletier de Saint Fargeau shortly before his tragic
death. Lakanal, who was a member of the commission, now
began to work for the organization of higher education, and
abandoning the principle of his <i>Projet</i> advocated the establishment
of state-aided schools for primary, secondary and university
education. In October 1793 he was sent by the Convention to
the south-western departments and did not return to Paris
until after the revolution of Thermidor. He now became
president of the Education Committee and promptly abolished
the system which had had Robespierre&rsquo;s support. He drew up
schemes for departmental normal schools, for primary schools
(reviving in substance the <i>Projet</i>) and central schools. He
presently acquiesced in the supersession of his own system,
but continued his educational reports after his election to the
Council of the Five Hundred. In 1799 he was sent by the
Directory to organize the defence of the four departments on
the left bank of the Rhine threatened by invasion. Under the
Consulate he resumed his professional work, and after Waterloo
retired to America, where he became president of the university
of Louisiana. He returned to France in 1834, and shortly
afterwards, in spite of his advanced age, married a second time.
He died in Paris on the 14th of February 1845; his widow
survived till 1881. Lakanal was an original member of the
Institute of France. He published in 1838 an <i>Exposé sommaire
des travaux de Joseph Lakanal</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAKE, GERARD LAKE,<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Viscount</span> (1744-1808), British
general, was born on the 27th of July 1744. He entered the
foot guards in 1758, becoming lieutenant (captain in the army)
1762, captain (lieut.-colonel) in 1776, major 1784, and lieut.-colonel
in 1792, by which time he was a general officer in the army.
He served with his regiment in Germany in 1760-1762 and with
a composite battalion in the Yorktown campaign of 1781.
After this he was equerry to the prince of Wales, afterwards
George IV. In 1790 he became a major-general, and in 1793
was appointed to command the Guards Brigade in the duke of
York&rsquo;s army in Flanders. He was in command at the brilliant
affair of Lincelles, on the 18th of August 1793, and served on the
continent (except for a short time when seriously ill) until April
1794. He had now sold his lieut.-colonelcy in the guards, and
had become colonel of the 53rd foot and governor of Limerick.
In 1797 he was promoted lieut.-general. In the following year
the Irish rebellion broke out. Lake, who was then serving in
Ireland, succeeded Sir Ralph Abercromby in command of the
troops in April 1798, issued a proclamation ordering the surrender
of all arms by the civil population of Ulster, and on the 21st of
June routed the rebels at Vinegar Hill (near Enniscorthy, Co.
Wexford). He exercised great, but perhaps not unjustified,
severity towards all rebels found in arms. Lord Cornwallis
now assumed the chief command in Ireland, and in August sent
Lake to oppose the French expedition which landed at Killala
Bay. On the 29th of the same month Lake arrived at Castlebar,
but only in time to witness the disgraceful rout of the troops
under General Hely-Hutchinson (afterwards 2nd earl of Donoughmore);
but he retrieved this disaster by compelling the surrender
of the French at Ballinamuck, near Cloone, on the 8th of
September. In 1799 Lake returned to England, and soon afterwards
obtained the command in chief in India. He took over
his duties at Calcutta in July 1801, and applied himself to the
improvement of the Indian army, especially in the direction
of making all arms, infantry, cavalry and artillery, more mobile
and more manageable. In 1802 he was made a full general.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of war with the Mahratta confederacy in
1803 General Lake took the field against Sindhia, and within
two months defeated the Mahrattas at Coel, stormed Aligahr,
took Delhi and Agra, and won the great victory of Laswari
(November 1st, 1803), where the power of Sindhia was completely
broken, with the loss of thirty-one disciplined battalions, trained
and officered by Frenchmen, and 426 pieces of ordnance. This
defeat, followed a few days later by Major-General Arthur
Wellesley&rsquo;s victory at Argaum, compelled Sindhia to come to
terms, and a treaty with him was signed in December 1803.
Operations were, however, continued against his confederate,
Holkar, who, on the 17th of November 1804, was defeated by
Lake at Farrukhabad. But the fortress of Bhurtpore held out
against four assaults early in 1805, and Cornwallis, who succeeded
Wellesley as governor-general in July of that year&mdash;superseding
Lake at the same time as commander-in-chief&mdash;determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
to put an end to the war. But after the death of Cornwallis
in October of the same year, Lake pursued Holkar into the
Punjab and compelled him to surrender at Amritsar in December
1805. Wellesley in a despatch attributed much of the success
of the war to Lake&rsquo;s &ldquo;matchless energy, ability and valour.&rdquo;
For his services Lake received the thanks of parliament, and was
rewarded by a peerage in September 1804. At the conclusion
of the war he returned to England, and in 1807 he was created a
viscount. He represented Aylesbury in the House of Commons
from 1790 to 1802, and he also was brought into the Irish parliament
by the government as member for Armagh in 1799 to
vote for the Union. He died in London on the 20th of February
1808.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAKE.<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> Professor Forel of Switzerland, the founder of the
science of limnology (Gr. <span class="grk" title="limnê">&#955;&#943;&#956;&#957;&#951;</span>, a lake), defines a lake (Lat.
<i>lacus</i>) as a mass of still water situated in a depression of the
ground, without direct communication with the sea. The term
is sometimes applied to widened parts of rivers, and sometimes
to bodies of water which lie along sea-coasts, even at sea-level
and in direct communication with the sea. The terms <i>pond</i>,
<i>tarn</i>, <i>loch</i> and <i>mere</i> are applied to smaller lakes according to size
and position. Some lakes are so large that an observer cannot
see low objects situated on the opposite shore, owing to the
lake-surface assuming the general curvature of the earth&rsquo;s
surface. Lakes are nearly universally distributed, but are more
abundant in high than in low latitudes. They are abundant in
mountainous regions, especially in those which have been
recently glaciated. They are frequent along rivers which have
low gradients and wide flats, where they are clearly connected
with the changing channel of the river. Low lands in proximity
to the sea, especially in wet climates, have numerous lakes, as,
for instance, Florida. Lakes may be either fresh or salt, according
to the nature of the climate, some being much more salt than the
sea itself. They occur in all altitudes; Lake Titicaca in South
America is 12,500 ft. above sea-level, and Yellowstone Lake
in the United States is 7741 ft. above the sea; on the other hand,
the surface of the Caspian Sea is 86 ft., the Sea of Tiberias 682 ft.
and the Dead Sea 1292 ft. below the level of the ocean.</p>

<p>The primary source of lake water is atmospheric precipitation,
which may reach the lakes through rain, melting ice and snow,
springs, rivers and immediate run-off from the land-surfaces.
The surface of the earth, with which we are directly in touch,
is composed of lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, and
these interpenetrate. Lakes, rivers, the water-vapour of the
atmosphere and the water of hydration of the lithosphere, must
all be regarded as outlying portions of the hydrosphere, which
is chiefly made up of the great oceans. Lakes may be compared
to oceanic islands. Just as an oceanic island presents many
peculiarities in its rocks, soil, fauna and flora, due to its isolation
from the larger terrestrial masses, so does a lake present peculiarities
and an individuality in its physical, chemical and biological
features, owing to its position and separation from the waters
of the great oceans.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Origin of Lakes.</i>&mdash;From the geological point of view, lakes may be
arranged into three groups: (A) Rock-Basins, (B) Barrier-Basins
and (C) Organic Basins.</p>

<p>A. <span class="sc">Rock-Basins</span> have been formed in several ways:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>By slow movements of the earth&rsquo;s crust</i>, during the formation of
mountains; the Lake of Geneva in Switzerland and the Lake of
Annecy in France are due to the subsidence or warping of part of the
Alps; on the other hand, Lakes Stefanie, Rudolf, Albert Nyanza,
Tanganyika and Nyasa in Africa, and the Dead Sea in Asia Minor,
are all believed to lie in a great rift or sunken valley.</p>

<p>2. <i>By Volcanic Agencies.</i>&mdash;Crater-lakes formed on the sites of
dormant volcanoes may be from a few yards to several miles in
width, have generally a circular form, and are often without visible
outlet. Excellent examples of such lakes are to be seen in the province
of Rome (Italy) and in the central plateau of France, where
M. Delebecque found the Lake of Issarlès 329 ft. in depth. The most
splendid crater-lake is found on the summit of the Cascade range of
Southern Oregon (U.S.A.). This lake is 2000 ft. in depth.</p>

<p>3. <i>By Subsidence due to Subterranean Channels and Caves in Limestone
Rocks.</i>&mdash;When the roofs of great limestone caves or underground
lakes fall in, they produce at the surface what are called <i>limestone
sinks</i>. Lakes similar to these are also found in regions abounding in
rock-salt deposits; the Jura range offers many such lakes.</p>

<p>4. <i>By Glacier Erosion.</i>&mdash;A. C. Ramsay has shown that innumerable
lakes of the northern hemisphere do not lie in fissures produced by
underground disturbances, nor in areas of subsidence, nor in synclinal
folds of strata, but are the results of glacial erosion. Many
flat alluvial plains above gorges in Switzerland, as well as in the
Highlands of Scotland, were, without doubt, what Sir Archibald
Geikie calls glen-lakes, or true rock-basins, which have been filled
up by sand and mud brought into them by their tributary streams.</p>

<p>B. <span class="sc">Barrier-Basins.</span>&mdash;These may be due to the following causes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>A landslip</i> often occurs in mountainous regions, where strata,
dipping towards the valley, rest on soft layers; the hard rocks slip
into the valley after heavy rains, damming back the drainage, which
then forms a barrier-basin. Many small lakes high up in the Alps
and Pyrenees are formed by a river being dammed back in this way.</p>

<p>2. <i>By a Glacier.</i>&mdash;In Alaska, in Scandinavia and in the Alps a
glacier often bars the mouth of a tributary valley, the stream flowing
therein is dammed back, and a lake is thus formed. The best-known
lake of this kind is the Märjelen Lake in the Alps, near the great
Aletsch Glacier. Lake Castain in Alaska is barred by the Malaspina
Glacier; it is 2 or 3 m. long and 1 m. in width when at its highest
level; it discharges through a tunnel 9 m. in length beneath the ice-sheet.
The famous parallel roads of Glen Roy in Scotland are successive
terraces formed along the shores of a glacial lake during the
waning glacial epoch. Lake Agassiz, which during the glacial period
occupied the valley of the Red River, and of which the present Lake
Winnipeg is a remnant, was formed by an ice-dam along the margin
of two great ice-sheets. It is estimated to have been 700 m. in length,
and to have covered an area of 110,000 sq. m., thus exceeding the
total area of the five great North American lakes: Superior (31,200),
Michigan (22,450), Huron with Georgian Bay (23,800), Erie (9960)
and Ontario (7240).</p>

<p>3. <i>By the Lateral Moraine of an Actual Glacier.</i>&mdash;These lakes sometimes
occur in the Alps of Central Europe and in the Pyrenees
Mountains.</p>

<p>4. <i>By the Frontal Moraine of an Ancient Glacier.</i>&mdash;The barrier in
this case consists of the last moraine left by the retreating glacier.
Such lakes are abundant in the northern hemisphere, especially in
Scotland and the Alps.</p>

<p>5. <i>By Irregular Deposition of Glacial Drift.</i>&mdash;After the retreat of
continental glaciers great masses of glacial drift are left on the land-surfaces,
but, on account of the manner in which these masses were
deposited, they abound in depressions that become filled with water.
Often these lakes are without visible outlets, the water frequently
percolating through the glacial drift. These lakes are so numerous
in the north-eastern part of North America that one can trace the
southern boundary of the great ice-sheet by following the southern
limit of the lake-strewn region, where lakes may be counted by tens
of thousands, varying from the size of a tarn to that of the great
Laurentian lakes above mentioned.</p>

<p>6. <i>By Sand drifted into Dunes.</i>&mdash;It is a well-known fact that sand
may travel across a country for several miles in the direction of the
prevailing winds. When these sand-dunes obstruct a valley a lake
may be formed. A good example of such a lake is found in Moses
Lake in the state of Washington; but the sand-dunes may also fill up
or submerge river-valleys and lakes, for instance, in the Sahara,
where the Shotts are like vast lakes in the early morning, and in
the afternoon, when much evaporation has taken place, like vast
plains of white salt.</p>

<p>7. <i>By Alluvial Matter deposited by Lateral Streams.</i>&mdash;If the current
of a main river be not powerful enough to sweep away detrital matter
brought down by a lateral stream, a dam is formed causing a lake.
These lakes are frequently met with in the narrow valleys of the
Highlands of Scotland.</p>

<p>8. <i>By Flows of Lava.</i>&mdash;Lakes of this kind are met with in volcanic
regions.</p>

<p>C. <span class="sc">Organic Basins.</span>&mdash;In the vast tundras that skirt the Arctic
Ocean in both the old and the new world, a great number of frozen
ponds and lakes are met with, surrounded by banks of vegetation.
Snow-banks are generally accumulated every season at the same
spots. During summer the growth of the tundra vegetation is
very rapid, and the snow-drifts that last longest are surrounded
by luxuriant vegetation. When such accumulations of snow
finally melt, the vegetation on the place they occupied is much less
than along their borders. Year after year such places become more
and more depressed, comparatively to the general surface, where
vegetable growth is more abundant, and thus give origin to lakes.</p>

<p>It is well known that in coral-reef regions small bays are cut off
from the ocean by the growth of corals, and thus ultimately fresh-water
basins are formed.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Life History of Lakes.</i>&mdash;From the time of its formation a lake
is destined to disappear. The historical period has not been
long enough to enable man to have watched the birth, life and
death of any single lake of considerable size, still by studying the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
various stages of development a fairly good idea of the course
they run can be obtained.</p>

<p>In humid regions two processes tend to the extinction of a
lake, viz. the deposition of detrital matter in the lake, and the
lowering of the lake by the cutting action of the outlet stream
on the barrier. These outgoing streams, however, being very
pure and clear, all detrital matter having been deposited in the
lake, have less eroding power than inflowing streams. One
of the best examples of the action of the filling-up process is
presented by Lochs Doine, Voil and Lubnaig in the Callander
district of Scotland. In post-glacial times these three lochs
formed, without doubt, one continuous sheet of water, which
subsequently became divided into three different basins by the
deposition of sediment. Loch Doine has been separated from
Loch Voil by alluvial cones laid down by two opposite streams.
At the head of Loch Doine there is an alluvial flat that stretches
for 1½ m., formed by the Lochlarig river and its tributaries.
The long stretch of alluvium that separates Loch Voil from
Loch Lubnaig has been laid down by Calair Burn in Glen Buckie,
by the Kirkton Burn at Balquhidder, and by various streams
on both sides of Strathyre. Loch Lubnaig once extended to a
point ¾ m. beyond its present outlet, the level of the loch being
lowered about 20 ft. by the denuding action of the river Leny
on its rocky barrier.</p>

<p>In arid regions, where the rainfall is often less than 10 ins.
in the year, the action of winds in the transport of sand and dust
is more in evidence than that of rivers, and the effects of evaporation
greater than of precipitation. Salt and bitter lakes prevail
in these regions. Many salt lakes, such as the Dead Sea and the
Great Salt Lake, are descended from fresh-water ancestors,
while others, like the Caspian and Aral Seas, are isolated portions
of the ocean. Lakes of the first group have usually become salt
through a decrease in the rainfall of the region in which they
occur. The water begins to get salt when the evaporation from
the lake exceeds the inflow. The inflowing waters bring in a
small amount of saline and alkaline matter, which becomes
more and more concentrated as the evaporation increases.
In lakes of the second group the waters were salt at the outset.
If inflow exceeds evaporation they become fresher, and may
ultimately become quite fresh. If the evaporation exceeds the
inflow they diminish in size, and their waters become more and
more salt and bitter. The first lake which occupied the basin
of the Great Salt Lake of Utah appears to have been fresh, then
with a change of climate to have become a salt lake. Another
change of climate taking place, the level of the lake rose until it
overflowed, the outlet being by the Snake river; the lake then
became fresh. This expanded lake has been called Lake Bonneville,
which covered an area of about 17,000 sq. m. Another
change of climate in the direction of aridity reduced the level of
the lake below the level of the outlet, the waters became gradually
salt, and the former great fresh-water lake has been reduced
gradually to the relatively small Great Salt Lake of the present
day. The sites of extinct salt lakes yield salt in commercial
quantities.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Movements and Temperature of Lake-Waters.</i>&mdash;(1) In addition
to the rise and fall of the surface-level of lakes due to rainfall and
evaporation, there is a transference of water due to the action of wind
which results in raising the level at the end to which the wind is
blowing. In addition to the well-known progressive waves there are
also stationary waves or &ldquo;seiches&rdquo; which are less apparent. A
seiche is a standing oscillation of a lake, usually in the direction
of the longest diameter, but occasionally transverse. In a motion
of this kind every particle of the water of the lake oscillates synchronously
with every other, the periods and phases being the same
for all, and the orbits similar but of different dimensions and
not similarly situated. Seiches were first discovered in 1730 by
Fatio de Duillier, a well-known Swiss engineer, and were first
systematically studied by Professor Forel in the Lake of Geneva.
Large numbers of observations have been made by various observers
in lakes in many parts of the world. Henry observed a fifteen-hour
seiche in Lake Erie, which is 396 kilometres in length, and Endros
recorded a seiche of fourteen seconds in a small pond only 111 metres
in length. Although these waves cause periodical rising and falling
of the water-level, they are generally inconspicuous, and can only be
recorded by a registering apparatus, a limnograph. Standard work
has been done in the study of seiches by the Lake Survey of Scotland
under the immediate direction of Professor Chrystal, who has
given much attention to the hydrodynamical theories of the phenomenon.
Seiches are probably due to several factors acting together
or separately, such as sudden variations of atmospheric pressure,
changes in the strength or direction of the wind. Explanations such
as lunar attraction and earthquakes have been shown to be untenable
as a general cause of seiches.</p>

<p>2. <i>The water temperature of lakes</i> may change with the season
from place to place and from layer to layer; these changes are
brought about by insolation, by terrestrial radiation, by contract with
the atmosphere, by rain, by the inflow of rivers and other factors,
but the most important of all these are insolation and terrestrial
radiation. Fresh water has its greatest density at a temperature of
39.2° F., so that water both above and below this temperature floats
to the surface, and this physical fact largely determines the water
stratification in a lake. In salt lakes the maximum density point is
much lower, and does not come into play. In the tropical type of
fresh-water lake the temperature is always higher than 39° F., and the
temperature decreases as the depth increases. In the polar type the
temperature is always lower than 39° F., and the temperature
increases from the surface downwards. In the temperate type the
distribution of temperature in winter resembles the polar type,
and in summer the tropical type. In Loch Ness and other deep
Scottish lochs the temperature in March and April is 41° to 42° F.,
and is then nearly uniform from top to bottom. As the sun comes
north, and the mean air temperature begins to be higher than the
surface temperature, the surface waters gain heat, and this heating
goes on till the month of August. About this time the mean air
temperature falls below the surface temperature, and the loch begins
to part with its heat by radiation and conduction. The temperature
of the deeper layers beyond 300 ft. is only slightly affected throughout
the whole year. In the autumn the waters of the loch are divided
into two compartments, the upper having a temperature from 49° to
55° F., the deeper a temperature from 41° to 45°. Between these lies
the discontinuity-layer (<i>Sprungschicht</i> of the Germans), where there
is a rapid fall of temperature within a very short distance. In
August this discontinuity-layer is well marked, and lies at a depth of
about 150 ft.; as the season advances this layer gradually sinks
deeper, and the layer of uniform temperature above it increases in
depth, and slowly loses heat, until finally the whole loch assumes
a nearly uniform temperature. Many years ago Sir John Murray
showed by means of temperature observations the manner in which
large bodies of water were transferred from the windward to the leeward
end of a loch, and subsequent observations seem to show that,
before the discontinuity-layer makes its appearance, the currents
produced by winds are distributed through the whole mass of the
loch. When, however, this layer appears, the loch is divided into
two current-systems, as shown in the following diagram:&mdash;</p>

<tr><td class="caption" colspan="2">Current systems in a loch induced by wind at the surface. (After

<td class="f90" style="width: 50%; vertical-align: top;">
<p>E, Secondary surface current.</p>
<p>F, Secondary return current.</p></td></tr></table>

<p class="pt2">Another effect of the separation of the loch into two compartments
by the surface of discontinuity is to render possible the temperature-seiche.
The surface-current produced by the wind transfers a large
quantity of warm water to the lee end of the loch, with the result that
the surface of discontinuity is deeper at the lee than at the windward
end. When the wind ceases, a temperature-seiche is started, just
as an ordinary seiche is started in a basin of water which has been
tilted. This temperature-seiche has been studied experimentally
and rendered visible by superimposing a layer of paraffin on a layer
of water.</p>

<p>Wedderburn estimates the quantity of heat that enters Loch Ness
and is given out again during the year to be approximately sufficient
to raise about 30,000 million gallons of water from freezing-point to
boiling-point. Lakes thus modify the climate of the region in which
they occur, both by increasing its humidity and by decreasing
its range of temperature. They cool and moisten the atmosphere
by evaporation during summer, and when they freeze in winter a
vast amount of latent heat is liberated, and moderates the fall of
temperature.</p>

<p>Lakes act as reservoirs for water, and so tend to restrain floods,
and to promote regularity of flow. They become sources of
mechanical power, and as their waters are purified by allowing the
sediment which enters them to settle, they become valuable sources
of water-supply for towns and cities. In temperate regions small
and shallow lakes are likely to freeze all over in winter, but deep
lakes in similar regions do not generally freeze, owing to the fact that
the low temperature of the air does not continue long enough to cool
down the entire body of water to the maximum density point. Deep
lakes are thus the best sources of water-supply for cities, for in
summer they supply relatively cool water and in winter relatively
warm water. Besides, the number of organisms in deep lakes is
less than in small shallow lakes, in which there is a much higher
temperature in summer, and consequently much greater organic
growth. The deposits, which are formed along the shores and on the
floors of lakes, depend on the geological structure and nature of the
adjacent shores.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Biology</i>.&mdash;Compared with the waters of the ocean those of
lakes may safely be said to contain relatively few animals and
plants. Whole groups of organisms&mdash;the Echinoderms, for
instance&mdash;are unrepresented. In the oceans there is a much
greater uniformity in the physical and chemical conditions
than obtains in lakes. In lakes the temperature varies widely.
To underground lakes light does not penetrate, and in these
some of the organisms may be blind, for example, the blind
crayfish (<i>Cambarus pellucidus</i>) and the blind fish (<i>Amblyopsis
spelaeus</i>) of the Kentucky caves. The majority of lakes are
fresh, while some are so salt that no organisms have been found
in them. The peaty matter in other lakes is so abundant that
light does not penetrate to any great depth, and the humic acids
in solution prevent the development of some species. Indeed,
every lake has an individuality of its own, depending upon
climate, size, nature of the bottom, chemical composition
and connexion with other lakes. While the ocean contains
many families and genera not represented in lakes, almost
every genus in lakes is represented in the ocean.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The vertebrates, insects and flowering plants inhabiting lakes vary
much according to latitude, and are comparatively well known to
zoologists and botanists. The micro-fauna and flora have only
recently been studied in detail, and we cannot yet be said to know
much about tropical lakes in this respect. Mr James Murray, who
has studied the Scottish lakes, records in over 400 Scottish lochs 724
species (the fauna including 447 species, all invertebrates, and the
flora comprising 277 species) belonging to the following groups; the

<p>These organisms are found along the shores, in the deep waters,
and in the surface waters of the lakes.</p>

<p>The <i>littoral region</i> is the most populous part of lakes; the existence
of a rooted vegetation is only possible there, and this in turn supports
a rich littoral fauna. The greater heat of the water along the margins
also favours growth. The great majority of the species in Scottish
lochs are met with in this region. Insect larvae of many kinds are
found under stones or among weeds. Most of the Cladocera, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
Copepoda of the genus <i>Cyclops</i>, and the Harpacticidae are only found
in this region. Water-mites, nearly all the Rotifers, Gastrotricha,
Tardigrada and Molluscs are found here, and Rhizopods are abundant.
A large number of the littoral species in Loch Ness extends
down to a depth of about 300 ft.</p>

<p><i>The abyssal region</i>, in Scottish lochs, lies, as a rule, deeper than
300 ft., and in this deep region a well-marked association of animals
appears in the muds on the bottom, but none of them are peculiar
to it: they all extend into the littoral zone, from which they were
originally derived. In Loch Ness the following sparse population
was recorded:&mdash;</p>

<p>In addition, the following were found casually at great depths in
Loch Ness: <i>Hydra</i>, <i>Limnaea peregra</i>, <i>Proales daphnicola</i> and
<i>Lynceus affinis</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>pelagic region</i> of the Scottish lakes is occupied by numerous
microscopic organisms, belonging to the Zooplankton and Phytoplankton.
Of the former group 30 species belonging to the Crustacea,
Rotifera and Protozoa were recorded in Loch Ness. Belonging to the
second group 150 species were recorded, of which 120 were Desmids.
Some of these species of plankton organisms are almost universal in
the Scottish lochs, while others are quite local. Some of the species
occur all the year through, while others have only been recorded in
summer or in winter. The great development of Algae in the surface
waters, called &ldquo;flowering of the water&rdquo; (<i>Wasserblüthe</i>), was observed
in August in Loch Lomond; a distinct &ldquo;flowering,&rdquo; due to Chlorophyceae,
has been observed in shallow lochs as early as July. It
is most common in August and September, but has also been
observed in winter.</p>

<p>The plankton animals which are dominant or common, both over
Scotland and the rest of Europe, are:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p><i>Diaptomus gracilis.</i></p>
<p><i>Daphnia kyalina.</i></p>

<p><i>Notholca longispina.</i></p>
<p><i>Ceratium hirundinella.</i></p>
<p><i>Asterionella.</i></p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>All of these, according to Dr Lund, belong to the general plankton
association of the European plain, or are even cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>The Scottish plankton on the whole differs from the plankton of
the central European plateau, and from the cosmopolitan fresh-water
plankton, in the extraordinary richness of the Phytoplankton
in species of Desmids, in the conspicuous arctic element among the
Crustacea, in the absence or comparative rarity of the species
commonest in the general European plankton. Another peculiarity
is the local distribution of some of the Crustacea and many of the
Desmids.</p>

<p>The derivation of the whole lacustrine population of the Scottish
lochs does not seem to present any difficulty. The abyssal forms
have been traced to the littoral zone without any perceptible modifications.
The plankton organisms are a mingling of European and
arctic species. The cosmopolitan species may enter the lochs by
ordinary migration. It is probable that if the whole plankton could
be annihilated, it would be replaced by ordinary migration within a
few years. The eggs and spores of many species can be dried up
without injury, and may be carried through the air as dust from one
lake to another; others, which would not bear desiccation, might
be carried in mud adhering to the feet of aquatic birds and in various
other ways. The arctic species may be survivors from a period when
arctic conditions prevailed over a great part of Europe. What are
known as &ldquo;relicts&rdquo; of a marine fauna have not been found in the
Scottish fresh-water lochs.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that none of the organisms living in
fresh-water lochs has been observed to exhibit the phenomenon of
phosphorescence, although similar organisms in the salt-water lochs
a few miles distant exhibit brilliant phosphorescence. At similar
depths in the sea-lochs there is usually a great abundance of life
when compared with that found in fresh-water lochs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAKE CHARLES,<a name="ar160" id="ar160"></a></span> a city of Louisiana, U.S.A., capital of
Calcasieu Parish, 30 m. from the Gulf of Mexico and about 218 m.
(by rail) W. of New Orleans. Pop. (1889) 838, (1890) 3442,
(1900) 6680 (2407 negroes); (1910) 11,449. It is served by the
Louisiana &amp; Texas (Southern Pacific System), the St Louis,
Watkins &amp; Gulf, the Louisiana &amp; Pacific and the Kansas City
Southern railways. The city is charmingly situated on the shore
of Lake Charles, and on the Calcasieu river, which with some
dredging can be made navigable for large vessels for 132 m.
from the Gulf. It is a winter resort. Among the principal
buildings are a Carnegie library, the city hall, the Government
building, the court house, St Patrick&rsquo;s sanatorium, the masonic
temple and the Elks&rsquo; club. Lake Charles is in the prairie region of
southern Louisiana, to the N. of which, covering a large part of the
state, are magnificent forests of long-leaf pine, and lesser lowland
growths of oak, ash, magnolia, cypress and other valuable
timber. The Watkins railway extending to the N.E. and the
Kansas City Southern extending to the N.W. have opened up
the very best of the forest. The country to the S. and W. is
largely given over to rice culture. Lake Charles is the chief
centre of lumber manufacture in the state, and has rice mills,
car shops and an important trade in wool. Ten miles W. are
sulphur mines (product in 1907 about 362,000 tons), which with
those of Sicily produce a large part of the total product of the
world. Jennings, about 34 m. to the E., is the centre of oil
fields, once very productive but now of diminishing importance.
Welsh, 23 m. E., is the centre of a newer field; and others lie
to the N. Lake Charles was settled about 1852, largely by
people from Iowa and neighbouring states, was incorporated
as a town in 1857 under the name of Charleston and again in
1867 under its present name, and was chartered as a city in 1886.
The city suffered severely by fire in April 1910.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAKE CITY,<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> a town and the county-seat of Columbia county,
Florida, U.S.A., 59 m. by rail W. by S. of Jacksonville. Pop.
(1900) 4013, of whom 2159 were negroes; (1905) 6509; (1910)
5032. Lake City is served by the Atlantic Coast Line, the
Seaboard Air Line and the Georgia Southern &amp; Florida railways.
There are ten small lakes in the neighbourhood, and the town
is a winter and health resort. It is the seat of Columbia College
(Baptist, 1907); the Florida Agricultural College was opened
here in 1883, became the university of Florida in 1903, and in
1905 was abolished by the Buckman Law. Vegetables and fruits
grown for the northern markets, sea-island cotton and tobacco
are important products of the surrounding country, and Lake
City has some trade in cotton, lumber, phosphates and turpentine.
The town was first settled about 1826 as Alligator; it was
incorporated in 1854; adopted the present name in 1859;
and in 1901, with an enlarged area, was re-incorporated.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAKE DISTRICT,<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> in England, a district containing all the
principal English lakes, and variously termed the Lake Country,
Lakeland and &ldquo;the Lakes.&rdquo; It falls within the north-western
counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and Lancashire (Furness
district), about one-half being within the first of these. Although
celebrated far outside the confines of Great Britain as a district
of remarkable and strongly individual physical beauty, its area
is only some 700 sq. m., a circle with radius of 15 m. from the
central point covering practically the whole. Within this circle,
besides the largest lake, Windermere, is the highest point in
England, Scafell Pike; yet Windermere is but 10½ m. in length,
and covers an area of 5.69 sq. m., while Scafell Pike is only
3210 ft. in height. But the lakes show a wonderful variety of
character, from open expanse and steep rock-bound shores to
picturesque island-groups and soft wooded banks; while the
mountains have always a remarkable dignity, less from the
profile of their summits than from the bold sweeping lines of
their flanks, unbroken by vegetation, and often culminating
in sheer cliffs or crags. At their feet, the flat green valley floors
of the higher elevations give place in the lower parts to lovely
woods. The streams are swift and clear, and numerous small
waterfalls are characteristic of the district. To the north, west
and south, a flat coastal belt, bordering the Irish Sea, with its
inlets Morecambe Bay and Solway Firth, and broadest in the
north, marks off the Lake District, while to the east the valleys
of the Eden and the Lune divide it from the Pennine mountain
system. Geologically, too, it is individual. Its centre is of
volcanic rocks, complex in character, while the Coal-measures
and New Red Sandstone appear round the edges. The district
as a whole is grooved by a main depression, running from north
to south along the valleys of St John, Thirlmere, Grasmere and
Windermere, surmounting a pass (Dunmail Raise) of only
783 ft.; while a secondary depression, in the same direction,
runs along Derwentwater, Borrowdale, Wasdale and Wastwater,
but here Sty Head Pass, between Borrowdale and Wasdale,
rises to 1600 ft. The centre of the 15-m. radius lies on the
lesser heights between Langstrath and Dunmail Raise, which
may, however, be the crown of an ancient dome of rocks, &ldquo;the
dissected skeleton of which, worn by the warfare of air and rain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span>
and ice, now alone remains&rdquo; (Dr H. R. Mill, &ldquo;Bathymetrical
Survey of the English Lakes,&rdquo; <i>Geographical Journal</i>, vi. 48).
The principal features of the district may be indicated by following
this circle round from north, by west, south and east.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The river Derwent (<i>q.v.</i>), rising in the tarns and &ldquo;gills&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ghylls&rdquo; (small streams running in deeply-grooved clefts) north of
Sty Head Pass and the Scafell mass flows north through the wooded
Borrowdale and forms Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite. These
two lakes are in a class apart from all the rest, being broader for their
length, and quite shallow (about 18 ft. average and 70 ft. maximum),
as distinct from the long, narrow and deep troughs occupied by the
other chief lakes, which average from 40 to 135 ft. deep. Derwentwater
(<i>q.v.</i>), studded with many islands, is perhaps the most beautiful
of all. Borrowdale is joined on the east by the bare wild dale of
Langstrath, and the Greta joins the Derwent immediately below
Derwentwater; the town of Keswick lying near the junction.
Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite occupy a single depression, a flat
alluvial plain separating them. From Seatoller in Borrowdale a road
traverses Honister Pass (1100 ft.), whence it descends westward,
beneath the majestic Honister Crags, where green slate is quarried,
into the valley containing Buttermere (94 ft. max. depth) and
Crummock Water (144 ft.), drained by the Cocker. Between this
and the Derwent valley the principal height is Grasmoor (2791 ft.);
southward a steep narrow ridge (High Style, 2643) divides it from
Ennerdale, containing Ennerdale Water (148 ft. max. depth), which is
fed by the Liza and drained by the Ehen. A splendid range separates
this dale from Wasdale and its tributary Mosedale, including Great
Gable (2949 ft.), Pillar (2927), with the precipitous Pillar Rock on
the Ennerdale flank and Steeple (2746). Wasdale Head, between
Gable and the Scafell range, is peculiarly grand, with dark grey
screes and black crags frowning above its narrow bottom. On this
side of Gable is the fine detached rock, Napes Needle. Wastwater,
3 m. in length, is the deepest lake of all (258 ft.), its floor, like those
of Windermere and Ullswater, sinking below sea-level. Its east
shore consists of a great range of screes. East of Wasdale lies the
range of Scafell (<i>q.v.</i>), its chief points being Scafell (3162 ft.), Scafell
Pike (3210), Lingmell (2649) and Great End (2984), while the line is
continued over Esk Hause Pass (2490) along a fine line of heights
(Bow Fell, 2960; Crinkle Crags, 2816), to embrace the head of
Eskdale. The line then descends to Wrynose Pass (1270 ft.), from
which the Duddon runs south through a vale of peculiar richness in
its lower parts; while the range continues south to culminate in the
Old Man of Coniston (2633) with the splendid Dow Crags above
Goats Water. The pleasant vale of Yewdale drains south to Coniston
Lake (5½ m. long, 184 ft. max. depth), east of which a lower, well-wooded
tract, containing two beautiful lesser lakes, Tarn Hows and
Esthwaite Water, extends to Windermere (<i>q.v.</i>). This lake collects
waters by the Brathay from Langdale, the head of which, between
Bow Fell and Langdale Pikes (2401 ft.), is very fine; and by the
Rothay from Dunmail Raise and the small lakes of Grasmere and
Rydal Water, embowered in woods. East of the Rothay valley and
Thirlmere lies the mountain mass including Helvellyn (3118 ft.),
Fairfield (2863) and other points, with magnificent crags at several
places on the eastern side towards Grisedale and Patterdale. These
dales drain to Ullswater (205 ft. max., second to Windermere in area),
and so north-east to the Eden. To the east and south-east lies the
ridge named High Street (2663 ft.), from the Roman road still traceable
from south to north along its summit, and sloping east again to
the sequestered Hawes Water (103 ft. max.), a curiously shaped lake
nearly divided by the delta of the Measand Beck. There remains the
Thirlmere valley. Thirlmere itself was raised in level, and adapted
by means of a dam at the north end, as a reservoir for the water-supply
of Manchester in 1890-1894. It drains north by St John&rsquo;s
Vale into the Greta, north of which again rises a mountain-group of
which the chief summits are Saddleback or Blencathra (2847 ft.) and
the graceful peak of Skiddaw (3054). The most noteworthy waterfalls
are&mdash;Scale Force (Dano-Norwegian <i>fors</i>, <i>foss</i>), beside Crummock,
Lodore near Derwentwater, Dungeon Gill Force, beside Langdale,
Dalegarth Force in Eskdale, Aira near Ullswater, sung by Wordsworth,
Stock Gill Force and Rydal Falls near Ambleside.</p>

<p>The principal centres in the Lake District are Keswick (Derwentwater),
Ambleside, Bowness, Windermere and Lakeside (Windermere),
Coniston and Boot (Eskdale), all of which, except Ambleside
and Bowness (which nearly joins Windermere) are accessible by rail.
The considerable village of Grasmere lies beautifully at the head of
the lake of that name; and above Esthwaite is the small town of
Hawkshead, with an ancient church, and picturesque houses curiously
built on the hill-slope and sometimes spanning the streets. There are
regular steamer services on Windermere and Ullswater. Coaches
and cars traverse the main roads during the summer, but many of
the finest dales and passes are accessible only on foot or by ponies.
All the mountains offer easy routes to pedestrians, but some of them,
as Scafell, Pillar, Gable (Napes Needle), Pavey Ark above Langdale
and Dow Crags near Coniston, also afford ascents for experienced
climbers.</p>

<p>This mountainous district, having the sea to the west, records an
unusually heavy rainfall. Near Seathwaite, below Styhead Pass,
the largest annual rainfall in the British Isles is recorded, the average
(1870-1899) being 133.53 in., while 173.7 was measured in 1903
and 243.98 in. in 1872. At Keswick the annual mean is 60.02, at
Grasmere about 80 ins. The months of maximum rainfall at Seathwaite
are November, December and January and September.</p>

<p>Fish taken in the lakes include perch, pike, char and trout in
Windermere, Ennerdale, Bassenthwaite, Derwentwater, &amp;c., and the
gwyniad or fresh-water herring in Ullswater. The industries of the
Lake District include slate quarrying and some lead and zinc mining,
and weaving, bobbin-making and pencil-making.</p>

<p>Setting aside London and Edinburgh, no locality in the British
Isles is so intimately associated with the history of English literature
as the Lake District. In point of time the poet whose name is first
connected with the region is Gray, who wrote a journal of his tour in
1769. But it was Wordsworth, a native of Cumberland, born on the
outskirts of the Lake District itself, who really made it a Mecca for
lovers of English poetry. Out of his long life of eighty years, sixty
were spent amid its lakes and mountains, first as a schoolboy at
Hawkshead, and afterwards as a resident at Grasmere (1799-1813)
and Rydal Mount (1813-1850). In the churchyard of Grasmere the
poet and his wife lie buried; and very near to them are the remains
of Hartley Coleridge (son of the poet), who himself lived many years
at Keswick, Ambleside and Grasmere. Southey, the friend of Wordsworth,
was a resident of Keswick for forty years (1803-1843), and
was buried in Crosthwaite churchyard. Samuel Taylor Coleridge
lived some time at Keswick, and also with the Wordsworths at
Grasmere. From 1807 to 1815 Christopher North (John Wilson) was
settled at Windermere. De Quincey spent the greater part of the
years 1809 to 1828 at Grasmere, in the first cottage which Wordsworth
had inhabited. Ambleside, or its environs, was also the place
of residence of Dr Arnold (of Rugby), who spent there the vacations
of the last ten years of his life; and of Harriet Martineau, who built
herself a house there in 1845. At Keswick Mrs Lynn Linton was
born in 1822. Brantwood, a house beside Coniston Lake, was the
home of Ruskin during the last years of his life. In addition to
these residents or natives of the locality, Shelley, Scott, Nathaniel
Hawthorne, Clough, Crabb Robinson, Carlyle, Keats, Tennyson,
Matthew Arnold, Mrs Hemans, Gerald Massey and others of less
reputation made longer or shorter visits, or were bound by ties of
friendship with the poets already mentioned. The Vale of St John,
near Keswick, recalls Scott&rsquo;s <i>Bridal of Triermain</i>. But there is a
deeper connexion than this between the Lake District and English
letters. German literature tells of several literary schools, or groups
of writers animated by the same ideas, and working in the spirit of
the same principles and by the same poetic methods. The most
notable instance&mdash;indeed it is almost the only instance&mdash;of the kind
in English literature is the Lake School of Poets. Of this school the
acknowledged head and founder was Wordsworth, and the tenets
it professed are those laid down by the poet himself in the famous
preface to the edition of <i>The Lyrical Ballads</i> which he published in
1800. Wordsworth&rsquo;s theories of poetry&mdash;the objects best suited for
poetic treatment, the characteristics of such treatment and the
choice of diction suitable for the purpose&mdash;may be said to have
grown out of the soil and substance of the lakes and mountains, and
out of the homely lives of the people, of Cumberland and Westmoreland.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAKE DWELLINGS,<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> the term employed in archaeology for
habitations constructed, not on the dry land, but within the
margins of lakes or creeks at some distance from the shore.</p>

<p>The villages of the Guajiros in the Gulf of Maracaibo are
described by Goering as composed of houses with low sloping
roofs perched on lofty piles and connected with each other by
bridges of planks. Each house consisted of two apartments;
the floor was formed of split stems of trees set close together
and covered with mats; they were reached from the shore by
dug-out canoes poled over the shallow waters, and a notched
tree trunk served as a ladder. The custom is also common in
the estuaries of the Orinoco and Amazon. A similar system
prevails in New Guinea. Dumont d&rsquo;Urville describes four such
villages in the Bay of Dorei, containing from eight to fifteen
blocks or clusters of houses, each block separately built on piles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
and consisting of a row of distinct dwellings. C. D. Cameron
describes three villages thus built on piles in Lake Mohrya, or
Moria, in Central Africa, the motive here being to prevent surprise
by bands of slave-catchers. Similar constructions have been
described by travellers, among the Dyaks of Borneo, in Celebes,
in the Caroline Islands, on the Gold Coast of Africa, and in other
places.</p>

<p>Hippocrates, writing in the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, says of the people
of the Phasis that their country is hot and marshy and subject
to frequent inundations, and that they live in houses of timber
and reeds constructed in the midst of the waters, and use boats
of a single tree trunk. Herodotus, writing also in the 5th
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, describes the people of Lake Prasias as living in
houses constructed on platforms supported on piles in the middle
of the lake, which are approached from the land by a single
narrow bridge. Abulfeda the geographer, writing in the 13th
century, notices the fact that part of the Apamaean Lake was
inhabited by Christian fishermen who lived on the lake in wooden
huts built on piles, and Sir John Lubbock (Lord Avebury)
mentions that the Rumelian fishermen on Lake Prasias &ldquo;still
inhabit wooden cottages built over the water, as in the time of
Herodotus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The records of the wars in Ireland in the 16th century show
that the petty chieftains of that time had their defensive strongholds
constructed in the &ldquo;freshwater lochs&rdquo; of the country,
and there is record evidence of a similar system in the western
parts of Scotland. The archaeological researches of the past
fifty years have shown that such artificial constructions in lakes
were used as defensive dwellings by the Celtic people from an
early period to medieval times (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crannog</a></span>). Similar researches
have also established the fact that in prehistoric times nearly
all the lakes of Switzerland, and many in the adjoining countries&mdash;in
Savoy and the north of Italy, in Austria and Hungary and
in Mecklenburg and Pomerania&mdash;were peopled, so to speak,
by lake-dwelling communities, living in villages constructed on
platforms supported by piles at varying distances from the
shores. The principal groups are those in the Lakes of Bourget,
Geneva, Neuchâtel, Bienne, Zürich and Constance lying to the
north of the Alps, and in the Lakes Maggiore, Varese, Iseo and
Garda lying to the south of that mountain range. Many smaller
lakes, however, contain them, and they are also found in peat
moors on the sites of ancient lakes now drained or silted up, as
at Laibach in Carniola. In some of the larger lakes the number
of settlements has been very great. Fifty are enumerated in the
Lake of Neuchâtel, thirty-two in the Lake of Constance, twenty-four
in the Lake of Geneva, and twenty in the Lake of Bienne.
The site of the lake dwelling of Wangen, in the Untersee, Lake of
Constance, forms a parallelogram more than 700 paces in length
by about 120 paces in breadth. The settlement at Morges,
one of the largest in the Lake of Geneva, is 1200 ft. long by 150
ft. in breadth. The settlement of Sutz, one of the largest in the
Lake of Bienne, extends over six acres, and was connected with
the shore by a gangway nearly 100 yds. long and about 40 ft.
wide.</p>

<p>The substructure which supported the platforms on which
the dwellings were placed was most frequently of piles driven
into the bottom of the lake. Less frequently it consisted of a
stack of brushwood or fascines built up from the bottom and
strengthened by stakes penetrating the mass so as to keep it
from spreading. When piles were used they were the rough
stems of trees of a length proportioned to the depth of the water,
sharpened sometimes by fire and at other times chopped to a
point by hatchets. On their level tops the beams supporting
the platforms were laid and fastened by wooden pins, or inserted
in mortices cut in the heads of the piles. In some cases the
whole construction was further steadied and strengthened by
cross beams, notched into the piles below the supports of the
platform. The platform itself was usually composed of rough
layers of unbarked stems, but occasionally it was formed of
boards split from larger stems. When the mud was too soft to
afford foothold for the piles they were mortised into a framework
of tree trunks placed horizontally on the bottom of the lake.
On the other hand, when the bottom was rocky so that the piles
could not be driven, they were steadied at their bases by being
enveloped in a mound of loose stones, in the manner in which
the foundations of piers and breakwaters are now constructed.
In cases where piles have not been used, as at Niederwil and
Wauwyl, the substructure is a mass of fascines or faggots laid
parallel and crosswise upon one another with intervening layers
of brushwood or of clay and gravel, a few piles here and there
being fixed throughout the mass to serve as guides or stays. At
Niederwil the platform was formed of split boards, many of
which were 2 ft. broad and 2 or 3 in. in thickness.</p>

<p>On these substructures were the huts composing the settlement;
for the peculiarity of these lake dwellings is that they
were pile villages, or clusters of huts occupying a common
platform. The huts themselves were quadrilateral in form.
The size of each dwelling is in some cases marked by boards
resting edgeways on the platform, like the skirting boards over
the flooring of the rooms in a modern house. The walls, which
were supported by posts, or by piles of greater length, were
formed of wattle-work, coated with clay. The floors were of
clay, and in each floor there was a hearth constructed of flat
slabs of stone. The roofs were thatched with bark, straw, reeds
or rushes. As the superstructures are mostly gone, there is no
evidence as to the position and form of the doorways, or the size,
number and position of the windows, if there were any. In one
case, at Schussenried, the house, which was of an oblong quadrangular
form, about 33 by 23 ft., was divided into two rooms
by a partition. The outer room, which was the smaller of the
two, was entered by a doorway 3 ft. in width facing the south.
The access to the inner room was by a similar door through the
partition. The walls were formed of split tree-trunks set upright
and plastered with clay; and the flooring of similar timbers
bedded in clay. In other cases the remains of the gangways or
bridges connecting the settlements with the shore have been
discovered, but often the village appears to have been accessible
only by canoes. Several of these single-tree canoes have been
found, one of which is 43 ft. in length and 4 ft. 4 in. in its greatest
width. It is impossible to estimate with any degree of certainty
the number of separate dwellings of which any of these villages
may have consisted, but at Niederwil they stood almost contiguously
on the platform, the space between them not exceeding
3 ft. in width. The size of the huts also varied considerably.
At Niederwil they were 20 ft. long and 12 ft. wide, while at
Robenhausen they were about 27 ft. long by about 22 ft. wide.</p>

<p>The character of the relics shows that in some cases the settlements
have been the dwellings of a people using no materials
but stone, bone and wood for their implements, ornaments and
weapons; in others, of a people using bronze as well as stone and
bone; and in others again the occasional use of iron is disclosed.
But, though the character of the relics is thus changed, there is no
corresponding change in the construction and arrangements of
the dwellings. The settlement in the Lake of Moosseedorf,
near Bern, affords the most perfect example of a lake dwelling
of the Stone age. It was a parallelogram 70 ft. long by 50 ft.
wide, supported on piles, and having a gangway built on faggots
connecting it with the land. The superstructure had been
destroyed by fire. The implements found in the relic bed under
it were axe-heads of stone, with their haftings of stag&rsquo;s horn and
wood; a flint saw, set in a handle of fir wood and fastened with
asphalt; flint flakes and arrow-heads; harpoons of stag&rsquo;s horn
with barbs; awls, needles, chisels, fish-hooks and other implements
of bone; a comb of yew wood 5 in. long; and a skate
made out of the leg bone of a horse. The pottery consisted
chiefly of roughly-made vessels, some of which were of large size,
others had holes under the rims for suspension, and many were
covered with soot, the result of their use as culinary vessels.
Burnt wheat, barley and linseed, with many varieties of seeds
and fruits, were plentifully mingled with the bones of the stag,
the ox, the swine, the sheep and the goat, representing the
ordinary food of the inhabitants, while remains of the beaver,
the fox, the hare, the dog, the bear, the horse, the elk and the
bison were also found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span></p>

<p>The settlement of Robenhausen, in the moor which was
formerly the bed of the ancient Lake of Pfäffikon, seems to have
continued in occupation after the introduction of bronze. The
site covers nearly 3 acres, and is estimated to have contained
100,000 piles. In some parts three distinct successions of
inhabited platforms have been traced. The first had been
destroyed by fire. It is represented at the bottom of the lake
by a layer of charcoal mixed with implements of stone and bone
and other relics highly carbonized. The second is represented
above the bottom by a series of piles with burnt heads, and in
the bottom by a layer of charcoal mixed with corn, apples,
cloth, bones, pottery and implements of stone and bone, separated
from the first layer of charcoal by 3 ft. of peaty sediment intermixed
with relics of the occupation of the platform. The piles
of the third settlement do not reach down to the shell marl,
but are fixed in the layers representing the first and second
settlements. They are formed of split oak trunks, while those
of the two first settlements are round stems chiefly of soft wood.
The huts of this last settlement appear to have had cattle stalls
between them, the droppings and litter forming heaps at the lake
bottom. The bones of the animals consumed as food at this
station were found in such numbers that 5 tons were collected
in the construction of a watercourse which crossed the site.
Among the wooden objects recovered from the relic beds were
tubs, plates, ladles and spoons, a flail for threshing corn, a last
for stretching shoes of hide, celt handles, clubs, long-bows of
yew, floats and implements of fishing and a dug-out canoe 12 ft.
long. No spindle-whorls were found, but there were many
varieties of cloth, platted and woven, bundles of yarn and balls
of string. Among the tools of bone and stag&rsquo;s horn were
awls, needles, harpoons, scraping tools and haftings for stone
axe-heads. The implements of stone were chiefly axe-heads
and arrow-heads. Of clay and earthenware there were many
varieties of domestic dishes, cups and pipkins, and crucibles
or melting pots made of clay and horse dung and still retaining
the drossy coating of the melted bronze.</p>

<p>The settlement of Auvernier in the Lake of Neuchâtel is one
of the richest and most considerable stations of the Bronze age.
It has yielded four bronze swords, ten socketed spear-heads,
forty celts or axe-heads and sickles, fifty knives, twenty socketed
chisels, four hammers and an anvil, sixty rings for the arms and
legs, several highly ornate torques or twisted neck rings, and
upwards of two hundred hair pins of various sizes up to 16 in.
in length, some having spherical heads in which plates of gold
were set. Moulds for sickles, lance-heads and bracelets were
found cut in stone or made in baked clay. From four to five
hundred vessels of pottery finely made and elegantly shaped are
indicated by the fragments recovered from the relic bed. The Lac
de Bourget, in Savoy, has eight settlements, all of the Bronze
age. These have yielded upwards of 4000 implements, weapons
and ornaments of bronze, among which were a large proportion
of moulds and founders&rsquo; materials. A few stone implements
suggest the transition from stone to bronze; and the occasional
occurrence of iron weapons and pottery of Gallo-Roman origin
indicates the survival of some of the settlements to Roman times.</p>

<p>The relative antiquity of the earlier settlements of the Stone
and Bronze ages is not capable of being deduced from existing
evidence. &ldquo;We may venture to place them,&rdquo; says Dr F. Keller,
&ldquo;in an age when iron and bronze had been long known, but had
not come into our districts in such plenty as to be used for the
common purposes of household life, at a time when amber had
already taken its place as an ornament and had become an object
of traffic.&rdquo; It is now considered that the people who erected
the lake dwellings of Central Europe were also the people who
were spread over the mainland. The forms and the ornamentation
of the implements and weapons of stone and bronze found
in the lake dwellings are the same as those of the implements
and weapons in these materials found in the soil of the adjacent
regions, and both groups must therefore be ascribed to the
industry of one and the same people. Whether dwelling on the
land or dwelling in the lake, they have exhibited so many
indications of capacity, intelligence, industry and social organization
that they cannot be considered as presenting, even in
their Stone age, a very low condition of culture or civilization.
Their axes were made of tough stones, sawn from the block
and ground to the fitting shape. They were fixed by the butt in
a socket of stag&rsquo;s horn, mortised into a handle of wood. Their
knives and saws of flint were mounted in wooden handles and
fixed with asphalt. They made and used an endless variety of
bone tools. Their pottery, though roughly finished, is well made,
the vessels often of large size and capable of standing the fire
as cooking utensils. For domestic dishes they also made wooden
tubs, plates, spoons, ladles and the like. The industries of
spinning and weaving were largely practised. They made nets
and fishing lines, and used canoes. They practised agriculture,
cultivating several varieties of wheat and barley, besides millet
and flax. They kept horses, cattle, sheep, goats and swine.
Their clothing was partly of linen and partly of woollen fabrics
and the skins of their beasts. Their food was nutritious and
varied, their dwellings neither unhealthy nor incommodious.
They lived in the security and comfort obtained by social
organization, and were apparently intelligent, industrious and
progressive communities.</p>

<p>There is no indication of an abrupt change from the use of
stone to the use of metal such as might have occurred had the
knowledge of copper and bronze, and the methods of working
them, been introduced through the conquest of the original
inhabitants by an alien race of superior culture and civilization.
The improved cultural conditions become apparent in the
multiplication of the varieties of tools, weapons and ornaments
made possible by the more adaptable qualities of the new
material; and that the development of the Bronze age culture
in the lake dwellings followed the same course as in the surrounding
regions where the people dwelt on the dry land is evident
from the correspondence of the types of implements, weapons,
ornaments and utensils common to both these conditions of
life.</p>

<p>Other classes of prehistoric pile-structures akin to the lake
dwellings are the Terremare of Italy and the Terpen of Holland.
Both of these are settlements of wooden huts erected on piles,
not over the water, but on flat land subject to inundations.
The terremare (so named from the marly soil of which they
are composed) appear as mounds, sometimes of very considerable
extent, which when dug into disclose the remains and relic beds
of the ancient settlements. They are most abundant in the
plains of northern Italy traversed by the Po and its tributaries,
though similar constructions have been found in Hungary in the
valley of the Theiss. These pile-villages were often surrounded
by an earthen rampart within which the huts were erected in
more or less regular order. Many of them present evidence of
having been more than once destroyed by fire and reconstructed,
while others show one or more reconstructions at higher levels
on the same site. The contents of the relic beds indicate that
they belong for the most part to the age of bronze, although in
some cases they may be referred to the latter part of the Stone
age. Their inhabitants practised agriculture and kept the
common domestic animals, while their tools, weapons and
ornaments were mainly of similar character to those of the
contemporary lake dwellers of the adjoining regions. Some of
the Italian terremare show quadrangular constructions made
like the modern log houses, of undressed tree trunks superposed
longitudinally and overlapping at the ends, as at Castione in the
province of Parma. A similar mode of construction is found in
the pile-village on the banks of the Save, near Donja Dolina
in Bosnia, described in 1904 by Dr Truhelka. Here the larger
houses had platforms in front of them forming terraces at different
levels descending towards the river. There was a cemetery
adjacent to the village in which both unburnt and cremated
interments occurred, the former predominating. From the
general character of the relics this settlement appeared to belong
to the early Iron age. The Terpen of Holland appear as mounds
somewhat similar to those of the terremare, and were also pile
structures, on low or marshy lands subject to inundations from
the sea. Unlike the terremare and the lake dwellings they do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
not seem to belong to the prehistoric ages, but yield indications
of occupation in post-Roman and medieval times.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAKE GENEVA,<a name="ar164" id="ar164"></a></span> a city of Walworth county, Wisconsin,
U.S.A., 65 m. N.W. of Chicago. Pop. (1900) 2585, of whom
468 were foreign-born; (1905) 3449; (1910) 3079. It is served
by the Chicago &amp; Northwestern railway. The city is picturesquely
situated on the shores of Lake Geneva (9 m. long and
1½ to 3 m. wide), a beautiful body of remarkably clear water, fed
by springs, and encircled by rolling hills covered with thick
groves of hardwood trees. The region is famous as a summer
resort, particularly for Chicago people. The city is the seat
of Oakwood Sanitarium, and at Williams Bay, 6 m. distant,
is the Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago. Dairying
is the most important industrial interest. The first settlement
on Lake Geneva was made about 1833. The city was chartered
in 1893.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAKE OF THE WOODS,<a name="ar165" id="ar165"></a></span> a lake in the south-west of the
province of Ontario, Canada, bordering west on the province of
Manitoba, and south on the state of Minnesota. It is of
extremely irregular shape, and contains many islands. Its
length is 70 m., breadth 10 to 50 m., area 1500 sq. m. It
lies in the centre of the Laurentian region between Lakes
Winnipeg and Superior, and an area of 36,000 sq. m. drains
to it. It collects the waters of many rivers, the chief being
Rainy river from the east, draining Rainy Lake. By the Winnipeg
river on the north-east it discharges into Lake Winnipeg.
At its source Winnipeg river is 1057 ft. above the sea, and drops
347 ft. in its course of 165 m. The scenery both on and around
the lake is exceedingly beautiful, and the islands are largely
occupied by the summer residences of city merchants. Kenora,
a flourishing town at the source of the Winnipeg river, is the
centre of the numerous lumbering and mining enterprises of
the vicinity.</p>

about 42 m. N.W. of Ticonderoga. Pop. (1905) 1514; (1910)
1682. The village is served by the Delaware &amp; Hudson railway.
The region is one of the most attractive in the Adirondacks,
and is a much frequented summer resort. There are four good
golf courses here, and the village has a well-built club house,
called the &ldquo;Neighborhood House.&rdquo; The village lies on the
narrow strip of land (about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> m.) between Mirror Lake (about
1 m. long, N. and S., and <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> m. wide), and Lake Placid, about
5 m. long (N.N.E. by S.S.W.), and about 1½ m. (maximum)
broad; its altitude is 1864 ft. The lake is roughly divided,
from N. to S. by three islands&mdash;Moose, the largest, and Hawk,
both privately owned, and Buck&mdash;and is a beautiful sheet of
water in a picturesque setting of forests and heavily wooded
hills and mountains. Among the principal peaks in the vicinity
are Whiteface Mountain (4871 ft.), about 3 m. N.W. of the N.
end of the lake; McKenzie Mountain (3872 ft.), about 1 m.
to the W., and Pulpit Mountain (2658 ft.), on the E. shore.
The summit of Whiteface Mountain commands a fine view,
with Gothic (4738 ft.), Saddleback (4530 ft.), Basin (4825 ft.),
Marcy (5344 ft.), and McIntyre (5210 ft.) mountains about 10 m.
to the S. and Lake Champlain to the E., and to the N.E. may be
seen, on clear days, the spires of Montreal. In the valleys E.
and S. are the headwaters of the famous Ausable river. About
2 m. E. of the village, at North Elba, is the grave of the abolitionist,
John Brown, with its huge boulder monument, and near
it is another monument which bears the names of the 20 persons
who bought the John Brown farm and gave it to the state.
The railway to the village was completed in 1893. The village

<p><span class="bold">LAKHIMPUR,<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> a district of British India in the extreme east
of the province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. Area, 4529 sq. m.
It lies along both banks of the Brahmaputra for about 400 m.;
it is bounded N. by the Daphla, Miri, Abor and Mishmi hills,
E. by the Mishmi and Kachin hills, S. by the watershed of the
Patkai range and the Lohit branch of the Brahmaputra, and W.
by the districts of Darrang and Sibsagar. The Brahmaputra
is navigable for steamers in all seasons as far as Dibrugarh, in
the rainy season as far as Sadiya; its navigable tributaries
within the district are the Subansiri, Dibru and Dihing. The
deputy-commissioner in charge exercises political control over
numerous tribes beyond the inner surveyed border. The most
important of these tribes are the Miris, Abors, Mishmis, Khamtis,
Kachins and Nagas. In 1901 the population was 371,396,
an increase of 46% in the decade. The district has enjoyed
remarkable and continuous prosperity. At each successive
census the percentage of increase has been over 40, the present
population being more than three times as great as that of 1872.
This increase is chiefly due to the numerous tea gardens and to
the coal mines and other enterprises of the Assam Railways
and Trading Company. Lakhimpur was the first district into
which tea cultivation was introduced by the government, and
the Assam Company began operations here in 1840. The
railway, known as the Dibru-Sadiya line, runs from Dibrugarh
to Makum, with two branches to Talap and Margherita, and
has been connected across the hills with the Assam-Bengal
railway. The coal is of excellent quality, and is exported by
river as far as Calcutta. The chief oil-wells are at Digboi. The
oil is refined at Margherita, producing a good quality of kerosene
oil and first-class paraffin, with wax and other by-products.
The company also manufactures bricks and pipes of various
kinds. Another industry is cutting timber, for the manufacture
of tea-chests, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lakhimpur figures largely in the annals of Assam as the region
where successive invaders from the east first reached the Brahmaputra.
The Bara Bhuiyas, originally from the western provinces of
India, were driven out by the Chutias (a Shan race), and these in
their turn gave place to their more powerful brethren, the Ahoms,
in the 13th century. The Burmese, who had ruined the native
kingdoms, at the end of the 18th century, were in 1825 expelled by
the British, who placed the southern part of the country, together
with Sibsagar under the rule of Raja Purandhar Singh; but it was
not till 1838 that the whole was taken under direct British administration.
The headquarters are at Dibrugarh.</p>

Burgundy entrusted him with embassies to the pope and the

<p><span class="bold">LALANDE, JOSEPH JÉRÔME LEFRANÇAIS DE<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> (1732-1807),
French astronomer, was born at Bourg (department of Ain),
on the 11th of July 1732. His parents sent him to Paris to
study law; but the accident of lodging in the Hôtel Cluny, where
J. N. Delisle had his observatory, drew him to astronomy, and
he became the zealous and favoured pupil of both Delisle and
Pierre Lemonnier. He, however, completed his legal studies,
and was about to return to Bourg to practise there as an advocate,
when Lemonnier obtained permission to send him to Berlin, to
make observations on the lunar parallax in concert with those
of N. L. Lacaille at the Cape of Good Hope. The successful
execution of his task procured for him, before he was twenty-one,
admission to the Academy of Berlin, and the post of adjunct
astronomer to that of Paris. He now devoted himself to the
improvement of the planetary theory, publishing in 1759 a
corrected edition of Halley&rsquo;s tables, with a history of the celebrated
comet whose return in that year he had aided Clairault
to calculate. In 1762 J. N. Delisle resigned in his favour the
chair of astronomy in the Collège de France, the duties of which
were discharged by Lalande for forty-six years. His house
became an astronomical seminary, and amongst his pupils
were J. B. J. Delambre, G. Piazzi, P. Mechain, and his own
nephew Michel Lalande. By his publications in connexion
with the transit of 1769 he won great and, in a measure, deserved
fame. But his love of notoriety and impetuous temper compromised
the respect due to his scientific zeal, though these
faults were partially balanced by his generosity and benevolence.
He died on the 4th of April 1807.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Although his investigations were conducted with diligence rather
than genius, the career of Lalande must be regarded as of eminent
service to astronomy. As a lecturer and writer he gave to the
science unexampled popularity; his planetary tables, into which he
introduced corrections for mutual perturbations, were the best
available up to the end of the 18th century; and the Lalande prize,
instituted by him in 1802 for the chief astronomical performance of
each year, still testifies to his enthusiasm for his favourite pursuit.
Amongst his voluminous works are <i>Traité d&rsquo;astronomie</i> (2 vols., 1764;
enlarged edition, 4 vols., 1771-1781; 3rd ed., 3 vols., 1792); <i>Histoire
céleste française</i> (1801), giving the places of 50,000 stars; <i>Bibliographie
astronomique</i> (1803), with a history of astronomy from 1781
to 1802; <i>Astronomie des dames</i> (1785); <i>Abrégé de navigation</i> (1793);
<i>Voyage d&rsquo;un françois en Italie</i> (1769), a valuable record of his travels
in 1765-1766. He communicated above one hundred and fifty
papers to the Paris Academy of Sciences, edited the <i>Connoissance des
temps</i> (1759-1774), and again (1794-1807), and wrote the concluding
2 vols. of the 2nd edition of Montucla&rsquo;s <i>Histoire des mathématiques</i>

<p><span class="bold">LALLY, THOMAS ARTHUR,<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> <span class="sc">Comte de</span>, Baron de Tollendal
(1702-1766), French general, was born at Romans, Dauphiné,
in January 1702, being the son of Sir Gerard O&rsquo;Lally, an Irish
Jacobite who married a French lady of noble family, from
whom the son inherited his titles. Entering the French army
in 1721 he served in the war of 1734 against Austria; he was
present at Dettingen (1743), and commanded the regiment de
Lally in the famous Irish brigade at Fontenoy (May 1745). He
was made a brigadier on the field by Louis XV. He had previously
been mixed up in several Jacobite plots, and in 1745
accompanied Charles Edward to Scotland, serving as aide-de-camp
at the battle of Falkirk (January 1746). Escaping to
France, he served with Marshal Saxe in the Low Countries,
and at the capture of Maestricht (1748) was made a <i>maréchal
de camp</i>. When war broke out with England in 1756 Lally was
given the command of a French expedition to India. He
reached Pondicherry in April 1758, and at the outset met with
some trifling military success. He was a man of courage and a
capable general; but his pride and ferocity made him disliked
by his officers and hated by his soldiers, while he regarded the
natives as slaves, despised their assistance, and trampled on their
traditions of caste. In consequence everything went wrong with
him. He was unsuccessful in an attack on Tanjore, and had
to retire from the siege of Madras (1758) owing to the timely
arrival of the British fleet. He was defeated by Sir Eyre Coote
at Wandiwash (1760), and besieged in Pondicherry and forced
to capitulate (1761). He was sent as a prisoner of war to England.
While in London, he heard that he was accused in France of
treachery, and insisted, against advice, on returning on parole to
stand his trial. He was kept prisoner for nearly two years
before the trial began; then, after many painful delays, he was
sentenced to death (May 6, 1766), and three days later beheaded.
Louis XV. tried to throw the responsibility for what was undoubtedly
a judicial murder on his ministers and the public,
but his policy needed a scapegoat, and he was probably well
content not to exercise his authority to save an almost friendless
foreigner.</p>

(1751-1830), was born at Paris on the 5th of March 1751. He
was the legitimized son of the comte de Lally and only discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
the secret of his birth on the day of his father&rsquo;s execution, when
he resolved to devote himself to clearing his father&rsquo;s memory.
He was supported by Voltaire, and in 1778 succeeded in persuading
Louis XVI. to annul the decree which had sentenced the
comte de Lally; but the parlement of Rouen, to which the case
was referred back, in 1784 again decided in favour of Lally&rsquo;s
guilt. The case was retried by other courts, but Lally&rsquo;s innocence
was never fully admitted by the French judges. In 1779 Lally-Tollendal
bought the office of <i>Grand bailli</i> of Étampes, and in
1789 was a deputy to the states-general for the <i>noblesse</i> of Paris.
He played some part in the early stages of the Revolution, but
was too conservative to be in sympathy with all even of its
earlier developments. He threw himself into opposition to the
&ldquo;tyranny&rdquo; of Mirabeau, and condemned the epidemic of renunciation
which in the session of the 4th of August 1789
destroyed the traditional institutions of France. Later in the
year he emigrated to England. During the trial of Louis XVI.
by the National Convention (1793) he offered to defend the
king, but was not allowed to return to France. He did not
return till the time of the Consulate. Louis XVIII. created
him a peer of France, and in 1816 he became a member of the
French Academy. From that time until his death, on the 11th
of March 1830, he devoted himself to philanthropic work,
especially identifying himself with prison reform.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LALO, EDOUARD<a name="ar178" id="ar178"></a></span> (1823-1892), French composer, was born
at Lille, on the 27th of January 1823. He began his musical
studies at the conservatoire at Lille, and in Paris attended the
violin classes of Habeneck. For several years Lalo led a modest
and retired existence, playing the viola in the quartet party
organized by Armingaud and Jacquard, and in composing
chamber music. His early works include two trios, a quartet,
and several pieces for violin and pianoforte. In 1867 he took
part in an operatic competition, an opera from his pen, entitled
<i>Fiesque</i>, obtaining the third place out of forty-three. This
work was accepted for production at the Paris Opéra, but delays
occurred, and nothing was done. <i>Fiesque</i> was next offered to the
Théâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels, and was about to be produced
there when the manager became bankrupt. Thus, when nearly
fifty years of age, Lalo found himself in difficulties. <i>Fiesque</i>
was never performed, but the composer published the pianoforte
score, and eventually employed some of the music in other works.
After the Franco-German war French composers found their
opportunity in the concert-room. Lalo was one of these, and
during the succeeding ten years several interesting works from
his pen were produced, among them a sonata for violoncello, a
&ldquo;divertissement&rdquo; for orchestra, a violin concerto and the
<i>Symphonie Espagnole</i> for violin and orchestra, one of his best-known
compositions. In the meanwhile he had written a second
opera, <i>Le Roi d&rsquo;Ys</i>, which he hoped would be produced at the
Opéra. The administration offered him the &ldquo;scenario&rdquo; of a
ballet instead. Lalo was obliged to be content with this, and
set to work with so much energy that he fell ill, the last scenes
of the ballet being orchestrated by Gounod. <i>Namouna</i>, the
ballet in question, was produced at the Opéra in 1882. Six
years later, on the 7th of May 1888, <i>Le Roi d&rsquo;Ys</i> was brought
out at the Opéra Comique, and Lalo was at last enabled to taste
the sweets of success. Unfortunately, fame came to him too
late in life. A pianoforte concerto and the music to <i>Néron</i>, a
pantomimic piece played at the Hippodrome in 1891, were his
last two works. He had begun a new opera, but had only
written the first act when, on the 23rd of April 1892, he died.
This opera, <i>La Jacquerie</i>, was finished by Arthur Coquard, and
was produced in 1895 at Monte Carlo, Aix-les-Bains and
finally in Paris. Lalo had distinct originality, discernible in his
employment of curious rhythmic devices. His music is ever
ingenious and brilliantly effective.</p>

<p><span class="bold">L&#256;M&#256;ISM,<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> a system of doctrine partly religious, partly political.
Religiously it is the corrupt form of Buddhism prevalent in Tibet
and Mongolia. It stands in a relationship to primitive Buddhism
similar to that in which Roman Catholicism, so long as the
temporal power of the pope was still in existence, stood to
primitive Christianity. The ethical and metaphysical ideas
most conspicuous in the doctrines of L&#257;m&#257;ism are not confined
to the highlands of central Asia, they are accepted in great
measure also in Japan and China. It is the union of these ideas
with a hierarchical system, and with the temporal sovereignty
of the head of that system in Tibet, which constitutes what is
distinctively understood by the term L&#257;m&#257;ism. L&#257;m&#257;ism
has acquired a special interest to the student of comparative
history through the instructive parallel which its history presents
to that of the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>The central point of primitive Buddhism was the doctrine
of &ldquo;Arahatship&rdquo;&mdash;a system of ethical and mental self-culture,
in which deliverance was found from all the mysteries
and sorrows of life in a change of heart to be reached
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;Great Vehicle.&rdquo;</span>
here on earth. This doctrine seems to have been
held very nearly in its original purity from the time
when it was propounded by Gotama in the 6th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
to the period in which northern India was conquered by the
Huns about the commencement of the Christian era. Soon after
that time there arose a school of Buddhist teachers who called
their doctrine the &ldquo;Great Vehicle.&rdquo; It was not in any contradiction
to the older doctrine, which they contemptuously called the
&ldquo;Little Vehicle,&rdquo; but included it all, and was based upon it.
The distinguishing characteristic of the newer school was the
importance which it attached to &ldquo;Bodhisatship.&rdquo; The older
school had taught that Gotama, who had propounded the doctrine
of Arahatship, was a Buddha, that only a Buddha is capable
of discovering that doctrine, and that a Buddha is a man who
by self-denying efforts, continued through many hundreds of
different births, has acquired the so-called <i>Ten P&#257;ramit&#257;s</i> or
cardinal virtues in such perfection that he is able, when sin and
ignorance have gained the upper hand throughout the world,
to save the human race from impending ruin. But until the
process of perfection has been completed, until the moment
when at last the sage, sitting under the Wisdom tree acquires
that particular insight or wisdom which is called Enlightenment
or Buddhahood, he is still only a Bodhisat. The link of connexion
between the various Bodhisats in the future Buddha&rsquo;s successive
births is not a soul which is transferred from body to body,
but the <i>karma</i>, or character, which each successive Bodhisat
inherits from his predecessors in the long chain of existences.
Now the older school also held, in the first place, that, when a
man had, in this life, attained to Arahatship, his karma would
not pass on to any other individual in another life&mdash;or in other
words, that after Arahatship there would be no rebirth; and,
secondly, that four thousand years after the Buddha had proclaimed
the <i>Dhamma</i> or doctrine of Arahatship, his teaching
would have died away, and another Buddha would be required to
bring mankind once more to a knowledge of the truth. The
leaders of the Great Vehicle urged their followers to seek to
attain, not so much to Arahatship, which would involve only
their own salvation, but to Bodhisatship, by the attainment of
which they would be conferring the blessings of the Dhamma
upon countless multitudes in the long ages of the future. By
thus laying stress upon Bodhisatship, rather than upon Arahatship,
the new school, though they doubtless merely thought
themselves to be carrying the older orthodox doctrines to their
logical conclusion, were really changing the central point of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
Buddhism, and were altering the direction of their mental vision.
It was of no avail that they adhered in other respects in the main
to the older teaching, that they professed to hold to the same
ethical system, that they adhered, except in a few unimportant
details, to the old regulations of the order of the Buddhist mendicant
recluses. The ancient books, preserved in the <i>P&#257;li Pitakas</i>,
being mainly occupied with the details of Arahatship, lost their
exclusive value in the eyes of those whose attention was being
directed to the details of Bodhisatship. And the opinion that
every leader in their religious circles, every teacher distinguished
among them for his sanctity of life, or for his extensive learning,
was a Bodhisat, who might have and who probably had inherited
the karma of some great teacher of old, opened the door to a
flood of superstitious fancies.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that the new school found its earliest
professors and its greatest expounders in a part of India outside
the districts to which the personal influence of Gotama and of his
immediate followers had been confined. The home of early
Buddhism was round about Kosala and Magadha; in the
district, that is to say, north and south of the Ganges between
where Allahabad now lies on the west and Rajgir on the east.
The home of the Great Vehicle was, at first, in the countries
farther to the north and west. Buddhism arose in countries
where Sanskrit was never more than a learned tongue, and where
the exclusive claims of the Brahmins had never been universally
admitted. The Great Vehicle arose in the very stronghold of
Brahminism, and among a people to whom Sanskrit, like Latin
in the middle ages in Europe, was the literary <i>lingua franca</i>.
The new literature therefore, which the new movement called
forth, was written, and has been preserved, in Sanskrit&mdash;its
principal books of <i>Dharma</i>, or doctrine, being the following nine:
(1) <i>Prajñ&#257;-p&#257;ramit&#257;</i>; (2) <i>Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-vy&#363;ha</i>; (3) <i>Da&#347;a-bh&#363;m&#299;&#347;-vara</i>;
(4) <i>Sam&#257;dhi-r&#257;ja</i>; (5) <i>Lank&#257;vat&#257;ra</i>; (6) <i>Saddharma-pu&#7751;&#7693;ar&#299;ka</i>;
(7) <i>Tath&#257;gata-guhyaka</i>; (8) <i>Lalita-vistara</i>; (9) <i>Suvar&#7751;a-prabh&#257;sa</i>.
The date of none of these works is known with any certainty,
but it is highly improbable that any one of them is older than the
6th century after the death of Gotama. Copies of all of them
were brought to Europe by Mr B. H. Hodgson, and other copies
have been received since then; but only one of them has as
yet been published in Europe (the <i>Lalita Vistara</i>, edited by
Lofmann), and only two have been translated into any European
language. These are the <i>Lalita Vistara</i>, translated into French,
through the Tibetan, by M. Foucaux, and the <i>Saddharma
Pu&#7751;&#7693;ar&#299;ka</i>, translated into English by Professor Kern. The
former is legendary work, partly in verse, on the life of Gotama,
the historical Buddha; and the latter, also partly in verse,
is devoted to proving the essential identity of the Great and the
Little Vehicles, and the equal authenticity of both as doctrines
enunciated by the master himself.</p>

<p>Of the authors of these nine works, as of all the older Buddhist
works with one or two exceptions, nothing has been ascertained.
The founder of the system of the Great Vehicle is, however,
often referred to under the name of N&#257;g&#257;rjuna, whose probable
date is about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 200.</p>

<p>Together with N&#257;g&#257;rjuna, other early teachers of the Great
Vehicle whose names are known are Vasumitra, Vasubandhu,
&#256;ryadeva, Dharmap&#257;la and Gu&#7751;amati&mdash;all of whom were
looked upon as Bodhisats. As the newer school did not venture
so far as to claim as Bodhisats the disciples stated in the older
books to have been the contemporaries of Gotama (they being
precisely the persons known as Arahats), they attempted to
give the appearance of age to the Bodhisat theory by representing
the Buddha as being surrounded, not only by his human companions
the Arahats, but also by fabulous beings, whom they
represented as the Bodhisats existing at that time. In the
opening words of each Mah&#257;y&#257;na treatise a list is given of such
Bodhisats, who were beginning, together with the historical
Bodhisats, to occupy a position in the Buddhist church of
those times similar to that occupied by the saints in the corresponding
period of the history of Christianity in the Church of
Rome. And these lists of fabulous Bodhisats have now a distinct
historical importance. For they grow in length in the later
works; and it is often possible by comparing them one with
another to fix, not the date, but the comparative age of the
books in which they occur. Thus it is a fair inference to draw
from the shortness of the list in the opening words of the <i>Lalita
Vistara</i>, as compared with that in the first sections of the <i>Saddharma
Pu&#7751;&#7693;ar&#299;ka</i>, that the latter work is much the younger
of the two, a conclusion supported also by other considerations.</p>

<p>Among the Bodhisats mentioned in the <i>Saddharma Pu&#7751;&#7693;ar&#299;ka</i>,
and not mentioned in the <i>Lalita Vistara</i>, as attendant on the
Buddha are Mañju-&#347;r&#299; and Avalokite&#347;vara. That these saints
were already acknowledged by the followers of the Great Vehicle
at the beginning of the 5th century is clear from the fact that
Fa Hien, who visited India about that time, says that &ldquo;men
of the Great Vehicle&rdquo; were then worshipping them at Mathura,
not far from Delhi (F. H., chap. xvi.). These were supposed to
be celestial beings who, inspired by love of the human race,
had taken the so-called Great Resolve to become future Buddhas,
and who therefore descended from heaven when the actual
Buddha was on earth, to pay reverence to him, and to learn
of him. The belief in them probably arose out of the doctrine
of the older school, which did not deny the existence of the
various creations of previous mythology and speculation, but
allowed of their actual existence as spiritual beings, and only
deprived them of all power over the lives of men, and declared
them to be temporary beings liable, like men, to sin and ignorance,
and requiring, like men, the salvation of Arahatship.
Among them the later Buddhists seem to have placed their
numerous Bodhisats; and to have paid especial reverence to
Mañju-&#347;r&#299; as the personification of wisdom, and to Avalokite&#347;wara
as the personification of overruling love. The former
was afterwards identified with the mythical first Buddhist
missionary, who is supposed to have introduced civilization
into Tibet about two hundred and fifty years after the death of
the Buddha.</p>

<p>The way was now open to a rapid fall from the simplicity
of early Buddhism, in which men&rsquo;s attention was directed
to the various parts of the system of self-culture,
to a belief in a whole pantheon of saints or angels,
<span class="sidenote">The five mystic trinities.</span>
which appealed more strongly to the half-civilized
races among whom the Great Vehicle was now professed.
A theory sprang up which was supposed to explain
the marvellous powers of the Buddhas by representing them
as only the outward appearance, the reflection, as it were, or
emanation, of ethereal Buddhas dwelling in the skies. These
were called <i>Dhy&#257;ni Buddhas</i>, and their number was supposed
to be, like that of the Buddhas, innumerable. Only five of
them, however, occupied any space in the speculative world
in which the ideas of the later Buddhists had now begun to
move. But, being Buddhas, they were supposed to have their
Bodhisats; and thus out of the five last Buddhas of the earlier
teaching there grew up five mystic trinities, each group consisting
of one of these five Buddhas, his prototype in heaven
the Dhy&#257;ni Buddha, and his celestial Bodhisat. Among these
hypothetical beings, the creations of a sickly scholasticism,
hollow abstractions without life or reality, the particular trinity
in which the historical Gotama was assigned a subordinate
place naturally occupied the most exalted rank. Amit&#257;bha,
the Dhy&#257;ni-Buddha of this trinity, soon began to fill the largest
place in the minds of the new school; and Avalokite&#347;wara,
his Bodhisat, was looked upon with a reverence somewhat less
than his former glory. It is needless to add that, under the
overpowering influence of these vain imaginations, the earnest
moral teachings of Gotama became more and more hidden from
view. The imaginary saints grew and flourished. Each new
creation, each new step in the theory, demanded another,
until the whole sky was filled with forgeries of the brain, and
the nobler and simpler lessons of the founder of the religion
were hidden beneath the glittering stream of metaphysical
subtleties.</p>

<p>Still worse results followed on the change of the earlier point
of view. The acute minds of the Buddhist pandits, no longer
occupied with the practical lessons of Arahatship, turned their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
attention, as far as it was not engaged upon their hierarchy
of mythological beings, to questions of metaphysical speculation,
which, in the earliest Buddhism, are not only discouraged
but forbidden. We find long treatises on the nature of being,
idealistic dreams which have as little to do with the Bodhisatship
that is concerned with the salvation of the world as with the
Arahatship that is concerned with the perfect life. Only one
lower step was possible, and that was not long in being taken.
The animism common alike to the untaught Huns and to their
Hindu conquerors, but condemned in early Buddhism, was
allowed to revive. As the stronger side of Gotama&rsquo;s teaching
was neglected, the debasing belief in rites and ceremonies,
and charms and incantations, which had been the especial object
of his scorn, began to spread like the B&#299;rana weed warmed
by a tropical sun in marsh and muddy soil. As in India, after
the expulsion of Buddhism, the degrading worship of &#346;iva
and his dusky bride had been incorporated into Hinduism
from the savage devil worship of &#256;ryan and of non-&#256;ryan
tribes, so, as pure Buddhism died away in the north, the <i>Tantra</i>
system, a mixture of magic and witchcraft and sorcery, was
incorporated into the corrupted Buddhism.</p>

<p>The founder of this system seems to have been Asanga, an
influential monk of Pesh&#257;war, who wrote the first text-book of
the creed, the <i>Yog&#257;chch&#257;ra Bh&#363;mi &#346;&#257;stra</i>, in the 6th
century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Hsüan Tsang, who travelled in the first
<span class="sidenote">The Tantra system.</span>
half of the 7th, found the monastery where Asanga had
lived in ruins, and says that he had lived one thousand
years after the Buddha.<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Asanga managed with great dexterity
to reconcile the two opposing systems by placing a number of
&#346;aivite gods or devils, both male and female, in the inferior
heavens of the then prevalent Buddhism, and by representing
them as worshippers and supporters of the Buddha and of
Avalokite&#347;vara. He thus made it possible for the half-converted
and rude tribes to remain Buddhists while they brought offerings,
and even bloody offerings, to these more congenial shrines, and
while their practical belief had no relation at all to the Truths
or the Noble Eightfold Path, but busied itself almost wholly
with obtaining magic powers (<i>Siddhi</i>), by means of magic phrases
(<i>Dh&#257;rani</i>), and magic circles (<i>Ma&#7751;&#7693;ala</i>). Asanga&rsquo;s happy idea
bore but too ample fruit. In his own country and Nep&#257;l, the
new wine, sweet and luscious to the taste of savages, completely
disqualified them from enjoying any purer drink; and now in
both countries &#346;aivism is supreme, and Buddhism is even nominally
extinct, except in some outlying districts of Nep&#257;l. But this
full effect has only been worked out in the lapse of ages; the
Tantra literature has also had its growth and its development,
and some unhappy scholar of a future age may have to trace
its loathsome history. The nauseous taste repelled even the
self-sacrificing industry of Burnouf, when he found the later
Tantra books to be as immoral as they are absurd. &ldquo;The pen,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;refuses to transcribe doctrines as miserable in respect
of form as they are odious and degrading in respect of meaning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such had been the decline and fall of Buddhism considered
as an ethical system before its introduction into Tibet. The
manner in which its order of mendicant recluses, at first founded
to afford better opportunities to those who wished to carry
out that system in practical life, developed at last into a hierarchical
monarchy will best be understood by a sketch of the
history of Tibet.</p>

<p>Its real history commences with Srong Tsan Gampo, who
was born a little after 600 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, and who is said in the Chinese
chronicles to have entered, in 634, into diplomatic
relationship with Tai Tsung, one of the emperors of
<span class="sidenote">Early political history.</span>
the Tang dynasty. He was the founder of the present
capital of Tibet, now known as Lhasa; and in the
year 622 (the same year as that in which Mahomet fled from
Mecca) he began the formal introduction of Buddhism into
Tibet. For this purpose he sent the minister Thumi Sambhota,
afterwards looked upon as an incarnation of Mañju-&#347;r&#299;, to India,
there to collect the sacred books, and to learn and translate them.
Thumi Sambhota accordingly invented an alphabet for the
Tibetan language on the model of the Indian alphabets then in
use. And, aided by the king, who is represented to have been
an industrious student and translator, he wrote the first books
by which Buddhism became known in his native land. The
most famous of the works ascribed to him is the <i>Mani Kambum</i>,
&ldquo;the Myriad of Precious Words&rdquo;&mdash;a treatise chiefly on religion,
but which also contains an account of the introduction of
Buddhism into Tibet, and of the closing part of the life of Srong
Tsan Gampo. He is also very probably the author of another
very ancient standard work of Tibetan Buddhism, the <i>Samatog</i>,
a short digest of Buddhist morality, on which the civil laws of
Tibet have been founded. It is said in the <i>Mani Kambum</i> to
have fallen from heaven in a casket (Tibetan, <i>samatog</i>), and, like
the last-mentioned work, is only known to us in meagre abstract.</p>

<p>King Srong Tsan Gampo&rsquo;s zeal for Buddhism was shared
and supported by his two queens, Bribsun, a princess from Nep&#257;l,
and Wen Ching, a princess from China. They are related to
have brought with them sacred relics, books and pictures,
for whose better preservation two large monasteries were erected.
These are the cloisters of La Brang (Jokhang) and Ra Moché,
still, though much changed and enlarged, the most sacred abbeys
in Tibet, and the glory of Lhasa. The two queens have become
semi-divine personages, and are worshipped under the name of
the two <i>D&#257;r&#257;-Eke</i>, the &ldquo;glorious mothers,&rdquo; being regarded
as incarnations of the wife of &#346;iva, representing respectively
two of the qualities which she personifies, divine vengeance
and divine love. The former is worshipped by the Mongolians
as <i>Okkin Tengri</i>, &ldquo;the Virgin Goddess&rdquo;; but in Tibet and
China the rôle of the divine virgin is filled by <i>Kwan Yin</i>, a
personification of Avalokite&#347;vara as the heavenly word, who is
often represented with a child in her arms. Srong Tsan Gampo
has also become a saint, being looked upon as an incarnation
of Avalokite&#347;vara; and the description in the ecclesiastical
historians of the measures he took for the welfare of his subjects
do great credit to their ideal of the perfect Buddhist king. He is
said to have spent his long reign in the building of reservoirs,
bridges and canals; in the promotion of agriculture, horticulture
and manufactures; in the establishment of schools and colleges;
and in the maintenance of justice and the encouragement of
virtue. But the degree of his success must have been slight.
For after the death of himself and of his wives Buddhism gradually
decayed, and was subjected by succeeding kings to cruel
persecutions; and it was not till more than half a century
afterwards, under King Kir Song de Tsan, who reigned 740-786,
that true religion is acknowledged by the ecclesiastical historians
to have become firmly established in the land.</p>

<p>This monarch again sent to India to replace the sacred books
that had been lost, and to invite Buddhist pandits to translate
them. The most distinguished of those who came
were &#346;&#257;nta Rakshita, Padma Sambhava and Kamala
<span class="sidenote">The Tibetan sacred books.</span>
&#346;&#299;la, for whom, and for their companions, the king
built a splendid monastery still existing, at Samje,
about three days&rsquo; journey south-east of Lhasa. It was to them
that the Tibetans owed the great collection of what are still
regarded as their sacred books&mdash;the <i>Kandjur</i>. It consists of
100 volumes containing 689 works, of which there are two or
three complete sets in Europe, one of them in the India Office
library. A detailed analysis of these scriptures has been published
by the celebrated Hungarian scholar Csoma de Körös,
whose authoritative work has been republished in French with
complete indices and very useful notes by M. Léon Feer. These
volumes contain about a dozen works of the oldest school of
Buddhism, the H&#299;nay&#257;na, and about 300 works, mostly very
short, belonging to the Tantra school. But the great bulk of
the collection consists of Mah&#257;y&#257;na books, belonging to all
the previously existing varieties of that widely extended Buddhist
sect; and, as the Sanskrit originals of many of these writings
are now lost, the Tibetan translations will be of great value,
not only for the history of L&#257;m&#257;ism, but also for the history of
the later forms of Indian Buddhism.</p>

<p>The last king&rsquo;s second son, Lang Darma, concluded in May 822
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
a treaty with the then emperor of China (the twelfth of the Tang
dynasty), a record of which was engraved on a stone put up in
the above-mentioned great convent of La Brang (Jokhang),
and is still to be seen there.<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a> He is described in the church
chronicles as an incarnation of the evil spirit, and is said to have
succeeded in suppressing Buddhism throughout the greater part
of the land. The period from Srong Tsan Gampo down to the
death of Lang Darma, who was murdered about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 850, in a
civil war, is called in the Buddhist books &ldquo;the first introduction
of religion.&rdquo; It was followed by more than a century of civil
disorder and wars, during which the exiled Buddhist monks
attempted unsuccessfully again and again to return. Many
are the stories of martyrs and confessors who are believed to
have lived in these troublous times, and their efforts were at
last crowned with success, for in the century commencing with
the reign of Bilamgur in 971 there took place &ldquo;the second
introduction of religion&rdquo; into Tibet, more especially under the
guidance of the pandit At&#299;sha, who came to Tibet in 1041, and
of his famous native pupil and follower Brom Ston. The long
period of depression seems not to have been without a beneficial
influence on the persecuted Buddhist church, for these teachers
are reported to have placed the Tantra system more in the
background, and to have adhered more strongly to the purer
forms of the Mah&#257;y&#257;na development of the ancient faith.</p>

<p>For about three hundred years the Buddhist church of Tibet
was left in peace, subjecting the country more and more completely
to its control, and growing in power and in
wealth. During this time it achieved its greatest
<span class="sidenote">The temporal sovereignty of the L&#257;mas.</span>
victory, and underwent the most important change in
its character and organization. After the reintroduction
of Buddhism into the &ldquo;kingdom of snow,&rdquo; the
ancient dynasty never recovered its power. Its representatives
continued for some time to claim the sovereignty; but the
country was practically very much in the condition of Germany
at about the same time&mdash;chieftains of almost independent power
ruled from their castles on the hill-tops over the adjacent valleys,
engaged in petty wars, and conducted plundering expeditions
against the neighbouring tenants, whilst the great abbeys were
places of refuge for the studious or religious, and their heads were
the only rivals to the barons in social state, and in many respects
the only protectors and friends of the people. Meanwhile
Jenghiz Kh&#257;n had founded the Mongol empire, and his grandson
Kublai Kh&#257;n became a convert to the Buddhism of the Tibetan
L&#257;mas. He granted to the abbot of the S&#257;kya monastery in
southern Tibet the title of tributary sovereign of the country,
head of the Buddhist church, and overlord over the numerous
barons and abbots, and in return was officially crowned by the
abbot as ruler over the extensive domain of the Mongol empire.
Thus was the foundation laid at one and the same time of the
temporal sovereignty of the L&#257;mas of Tibet, and of the suzerainty
over Tibet of the emperors of China. One of the first acts of the
&ldquo;head of the church&rdquo; was the printing of a carefully revised
edition of the Tibetan Scriptures&mdash;an undertaking which
occupied altogether nearly thirty years and was not completed
till 1306.</p>

<p>Under Kublai&rsquo;s successors in China the Buddhist cause
flourished greatly, and the S&#257;kya L&#257;mas extended their power
both at home and abroad. The dignity of abbot at S&#257;kya
became hereditary, the abbots breaking so far the Buddhist
rule of celibacy that they remained married until they had
begotten a son and heir. But rather more than half a century
afterwards their power was threatened by a formidable rival
at home, a Buddhist reformer.</p>

<p>Tsongkapa, the Luther of Tibet, was born about 1357 on the
spot where the famous monastery of Kunbum now stands. He
very early entered the order, and studied at S&#257;kya,
Brigung and other monasteries. He then spent eight
<span class="sidenote">The Luther of Tibet.</span>
years as a hermit in Takpo in southern Tibet, where
the comparatively purer teaching of At&#299;sha (referred to
above) was still prevalent. About 1390 he appeared as a public
teacher and reformer in Lhasa, and before his death in 1419
there were three huge monasteries there containing 30,000 of his
disciples, besides others in other parts of the country. His
voluminous works, of which the most famous are the <i>Sumbun</i>
and the <i>Lam Nim Tshenpo</i>, exist in printed Tibetan copies in
Europe, but have not yet been translated or analysed. But
the principal lines on which his reformation proceeded are
sufficiently attested. He insisted in the first place on the
complete carrying out of the ancient rules of the order as to the
celibacy of its members, and as to simplicity in dress. One
result of the second of these two reforms was to make it necessary
for every monk openly to declare himself either in favour of or
against the new views. For Tsongkapa and his followers wore
the yellow or orange-coloured garments which had been the
distinguishing mark of the order in the lifetime of its founder,
and in support of the ancient rules Tsongkapa reinstated the
fortnightly rehearsal of the <i>P&#257;timokkha</i> or &ldquo;disburdenment&rdquo;
in regular assemblies of the order at Lhasa&mdash;a practice which
had fallen into desuetude. He also restored the custom of the
first disciples to hold the so-called <i>Vassa</i> or yearly retirement,
and the public meeting of the order at its close. In all these
respects he was simply following the directions of the Vinaya,
or regulations of the order, as established probably in the time
of Gotama himself, and as certainly handed down from the
earliest times in the pi&#7789;akas or sacred books. Further, he set
his face against the Tantra system, and against the animistic
superstitions which had been allowed to creep into life again.
He laid stress on the self-culture involved in the practice of the
p&#257;ramit&#257;s or cardinal virtues, and established an annual national
fast or week of prayer to be held during the first days of each
year. This last institution indeed is not found in the ancient
Vinaya, but was almost certainly modelled on the traditional
account of the similar assemblies convoked by Asoka and other
Buddhist sovereigns in India every fifth year. Laymen as well
as monks take part in the proceedings, the details of which are
unknown to us except from the accounts of the Catholic missionaries&mdash;Fathers
Huc and Gabet&mdash;who describe the principal
ceremonial as, in outward appearance, wonderfully like the
high mass. In doctrine the great Tibetan teacher, who had no
access to the P&#257;li Pi&#7789;akas, adhered in the main to the purer
forms of the Mah&#257;y&#257;na school; in questions of church government
he took little part, and did not dispute the titular supremacy
of the S&#257;kya L&#257;mas. But the effects of his teaching weakened
their power. The &ldquo;orange-hoods,&rdquo; as his followers were called,
rapidly gained in numbers and influence, until they so overshadowed
the &ldquo;red-hoods,&rdquo; as the followers of the older sect
were called, that in the middle of the 15th century the emperor
of China acknowledged the two leaders of the new sect at that
time as the titular overlords of the church and tributary rulers
over the realm of Tibet. These two leaders were then known
as the <i>Dalai L&#257;ma</i> and the <i>Pantshen L&#257;ma</i>, and were the abbots
of the great monasteries at Gedun Dubpa, near Lhasa, and at
Tashi Lunpo, in Farther Tibet, respectively. Since that time
the abbots of these monasteries have continued to exercise the
sovereignty over Tibet.</p>

<p>As there has been no further change in the doctrine, and no
further reformation in discipline, we may leave the ecclesiastical
history of L&#257;m&#257;ism since that date unnoticed, and
consider some principal points on the constitution of the
<span class="sidenote">Constitution of L&#257;m&#257;ism.</span>
L&#257;m&#257;ism of to-day. And first as to the mode of
electing successors to the two Great L&#257;mas. It will
have been noticed that it was an old idea of the northern
Buddhists to look upon distinguished members of the order as
incarnations of Avalokite&#347;vara, of Mañju-&#347;r&#299;, or of Amit&#257;bha.
These beings were supposed to possess the power, whilst they
continued to live in heaven, of appearing on earth in a <i>Nirm&#257;na-k&#257;ya</i>,
or apparitional body. In the same way the Pantshen L&#257;ma
is looked upon as an incarnation, the Nirm&#257;na-k&#257;ya, of Amit&#257;bha,
who had previously appeared under the outward form of
Tshonkapa himself; and the Dalai L&#257;ma is looked upon as an
incarnation of Avalokite&#347;vara. Theoretically, therefore, the
former, as the spiritual successor of the great teacher and also of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
Amit&#257;bha, who occupies the higher place in the mythology of the
Great Vehicle, would be superior to the latter, as the spiritual
representative of Avalokite&#347;vara. But practically the Dalai
L&#257;ma, owing to his position in the capital,<a name="fa3k" id="fa3k" href="#ft3k"><span class="sp">3</span></a> has the political
supremacy, and is actually called the <i>Gyalpo Rinpotshe</i>, &ldquo;the
glorious king&rdquo;&mdash;his companion being content with the title
<i>Pantshen Rinpotshe</i>, &ldquo;the glorious teacher.&rdquo; When either of
them dies it is necessary for the other to ascertain in whose body
the celestial being whose outward form has been dissolved has
been pleased again to incarnate himself. For that purpose the
names of all male children born just after the death of the
deceased Great L&#257;ma are laid before his survivor. He chooses
three out of the whole number; their names are thrown into a
golden casket provided for that purpose by a former emperor of
China. The Chutuktus, or abbots of the great monasteries, then
assemble, and after a week of prayer, the lots are drawn in their
presence and in presence of the surviving Great L&#257;ma and of the
Chinese political resident. The child whose name is first drawn is
the future Great L&#257;ma; the other two receive each of them 500
pieces of silver. The Chutuktus just mentioned correspond in
many respects to the Roman cardinals. Like the Great L&#257;mas,
they bear the title of Rinpotshe or Glorious, and are looked upon
as incarnations of one or other of the celestial Bodhisats of the
Great Vehicle mythology. Their number varies from ten to a
hundred; and it is uncertain whether the honour is inherent in
the abbacy of certain of the greatest cloisters, or whether the Dalai
L&#257;ma exercises the right of choosing them. Under these high
officials of the Tibetan hierarchy there come the Chubil Kh&#257;ns,
who fill the post of abbot to the lesser monasteries, and are also
incarnations. Their number is very large; there are few monasteries
in Tibet or in Mongolia which do not claim to possess one of
these living Buddhas. Besides these mystical persons there are in
the Tibetan church other ranks and degrees, corresponding to the
deacon, full priest, dean and doctor of divinity in the West. At
the great yearly festival at Lhasa they make in the cathedral an
imposing array, not much less magnificent than that of the clergy
in Rome; for the ancient simplicity of dress has disappeared in
the growing differences of rank, and each division of the spiritual
army is distinguished in Tibet, as in the West, by a special
uniform. The political authority of the Dalai L&#257;ma is confined
to Tibet itself, but he is the acknowledged head also of the
Buddhist church throughout Mongolia and China. He has no
supremacy over his co-religionists in Japan, and even in China
there are many Buddhists who are not practically under his
control or influence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMAR, LUCIUS QUINTUS CINCINNATUS<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span> (1825-1893),
American statesman and judge, was born at the old &ldquo;Lamar
Homestead,&rdquo; in Putnam county, Georgia, on the 17th of
September 1825. His father, Lucius Q. C. Lamar (1797-1834),
was an able lawyer, a judge of the superior court of Georgia,
and the compiler of the <i>Laws of Georgia from 1810 to 1819</i>
(1821). In 1845 young Lamar graduated from Emory College
(Oxford, Ga.), and in 1847 was admitted to the bar. In
1849 he removed to Oxford, Mississippi, and in 1850-1852
was adjunct professor of mathematics in the state university.
In 1852 he removed to Covington, Ga., to practise
law, and in 1853 was elected a member of the Georgia House of
Representatives. In 1855 he returned to Mississippi, and two
years later became a member of the National House of Representatives,
where he served until December 1860, when he withdrew
to become a candidate for election to the &ldquo;secession&rdquo;
convention of Mississippi. He was elected to the convention, and
drafted for it the Mississippi ordinance of secession. In the
summer of 1860 he had accepted an appointment to the chair of
ethics and metaphysics in the university of Mississippi, but,
having been appointed a lieutenant-colonel in the Confederate
Army in the spring of 1861, he resigned his professorship. The
colonel of his regiment (Nineteenth Mississippi) was killed early
in the battle of Williamsburg, on the 5th of May 1862, and the
command then fell to Lamar, but in October he resigned from
the army. In November 1862 he was appointed by President
Jefferson Davis special commissioner of the Confederacy to
Russia; but he did not proceed farther than Paris, and his
mission was soon terminated by the refusal of the Confederate
Senate to confirm his appointment. In 1866 he was again
appointed to the chair of ethics and metaphysics in the university
of Mississippi, and in the next year was transferred to the
chair of law, but in 1870, Republicans having become trustees
of the university upon the readmission of the state into the
Union, he resigned. From 1873 to 1877 he was again a Democratic
representative in Congress; from 1877 to 1885 he was a
United States senator; from 1885 to January 1888 he was
secretary of the interior; and from 1888 until his death at
Macon, Ga., on the 23rd of January 1893, he was an associate
justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. In Congress
Lamar fought the silver and greenback craze and argued forcibly
against the protective tariff; in the department of the interior
he introduced various reforms; and on the Supreme Court
bench his dissenting opinion in the <i>Neagle Case</i> (based upon a
denial that certain powers belonging to Congress, but not
exercised, were by implication vested in the department of
justice) is famous. But he is perhaps best known for the part he
took after the Civil War in helping to effect a reconciliation
between the North and the South. During the early secession
movement he strove to arouse the white people of the South
from their indifference, declaring that secession alone could save
them from a doom similar to that of the former whites of San
Domingo. He probably never changed his convictions as to the
righteousness of the &ldquo;lost cause&rdquo;; but he accepted the result
of the war as a final settlement of the differences leading to it, and
strove to restore the South in the Union, and to effect the reunion
of the nation in feeling as well as in government. This is in part
seen from such speeches as his eulogy on Charles Sumner (27th
of April 1874), his leadership in reorganizing the Democratic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
party of his own state, and his counsels of peace in the disputed
presidential election of 1876.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMARCK, JEAN BAPTISTE PIERRE ANTOINE DE MONET,<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span>
<span class="sc">Chevalier de</span> (1744-1829), French naturalist, was
born on the 1st of August 1744, at Bazantin, a village of Picardy.
He was an eleventh child; and his father, lord of the manor and
of old family, but of limited means, having placed three sons
in the army, destined this one for the church, and sent him to the
Jesuits at Amiens, where he continued till his father&rsquo;s death.
After this he would remain with the Jesuits no longer, and, not
yet seventeen years of age, started for the seat of war at Bergen-op-Zoom,
before which place one of his brothers had already
been killed. Mounted on an old horse, with a boy from the
village as attendant, and furnished by a lady with a letter of
introduction to a colonel, he reached his destination on the
evening before a battle. Next morning the colonel found that
the new and very diminutive volunteer had posted himself in
the front rank of a body of grenadiers, and could not be induced
to quit the position. In the battle, the company which he had
joined became exposed to the fire of the enemy&rsquo;s artillery, and
in the confusion of retreat was forgotten. All the officers and
subalterns were killed, and not more than fourteen men were left,
when the oldest grenadiers seeing there were no more French
in sight proposed to the young volunteer so soon become commandant
to withdraw his men. This he refused to do without
orders. These at last arrived; and for his bravery he was made
an officer on the spot, and soon after was named to a lieutenancy.</p>

<p>After the peace, the regiment was sent to Monaco. There
one of his comrades playfully lifted him by the head, and to this
it was imputed that he was seized with disease of the glands of the
neck, so severe as to put a stop to his military career. He went
to Paris and began the study of medicine, supporting himself by
working in a banker&rsquo;s office. He early became interested in
meteorology and in physical and chemical speculations of a
chimerical kind, but happily threw his main strength into
botany, and in 1778 published his <i>Flore française</i>, a work in
which by a dichotomous system of contrasting characters he
enabled the student with facility to determine species. This
work, which went through several editions and long kept the field,
gained for its author immediate popularity as well as admission
to the Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>In 1781 and 1782, under the title of botanist to the king, an
appointment obtained for him by Buffon, whose son accompanied
him, he travelled through various countries of Europe, extending
his knowledge of natural history; and on his return he began
those elaborate contributions to botany on which his reputation
in that science principally rests, namely, the <i>Dictionnaire de
Botanique</i> and the <i>Illustrations de Genres</i>, voluminous works
contributed to the <i>Encyclopédie Méthodique</i> (1785). In 1793, in
consequence of changes in the organization of the natural history
department at the Jardin du Roi, where he had held a botanical
appointment since 1788, Lamarck was presented to a zoological
chair, and called on to lecture on the <i>Insecta</i> and <i>Vermes</i> of
Linnaeus, the animals for which he introduced the term <i>Invertebrata</i>.
Thus driven, comparatively late in life, to devote his
principal attention to zoology instead of botany, he had the
misfortune soon after to suffer from impaired vision; and the
malady resulted subsequently in total blindness. Yet his
greatest zoological work, the <i>Histoire naturelle des animaux
sans vertèbres</i>, was published from 1815 to 1822, with the
assistance, in the last two volumes, of his eldest daughter and
of P. A. Latreille (1762-1833). A volume of plates of the fossil
shells of the neighbourhood of Paris was collected in 1823 from
his memoirs in the <i>Annales des Muséums</i>. He died on the 18th
of December 1829.</p>

<p>The character of Lamarck as a naturalist is remarkable alike
for its excellences and its defects. His excellences were width
of scope, fertility of ideas and a pre-eminent faculty of precise
description, arising not only from a singularly terse style, but
from a clear insight into both the distinctive features and the
resemblances of forms. That part of his zoological work which
constitutes his solid claim to the highest honour as a zoologist
is to be found in his extensive and detailed labours in the departments
of living and fossil <i>Invertebrata</i>. His endeavours at
classification of the great groups were necessarily defective on
account of the imperfect knowledge possessed in his time in
regard to many of them, <i>e.g.</i> echinoderms, ascidians and intestinal
worms; yet they are not without interest, particularly
on account of the comprehensive attempt to unite in one great
division as <i>Articulata</i> all those groups that appeared to present
a segmented construction. Moreover, Lamarck was the first
to distinguish vertebrate from invertebrate animals by the
presence of a vertebral column, and among the Invertebrata
to found the groups <i>Crustacea</i>, <i>Arachnida</i> and <i>Annelida</i>. In
1785 (<i>Hist. del&rsquo; Acad.</i>) he evinced his appreciation of the necessity
of natural orders in botany by an attempt at the classification
of plants, interesting, though crude and falling immeasurably
short of the system which grew in the hands of his intimate
friend A. L. de Jussieu. The problem of taxonomy has never
been put more philosophically than he subsequently put it in his
<i>Animaux sans vertèbres</i>: &ldquo;What arrangement must be given
to the general distribution of animals to make it conformable to
the order of nature in the production of these beings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most prominent defect in Lamarck must be admitted to
have been want of control in speculation. Doubtless the speculative
tendency furnished a powerful incentive to work, but it
outran the legitimate deductions from observation, and led him
into the production of volumes of worthless chemistry without
experimental basis, as well as into spending much time on fruitless
meteorological predictions. His <i>Annuaires Météorologiques</i> were
published yearly from 1800 to 1810, and were not discontinued
until after an unnecessarily public and brutal tirade from
Napoleon, administered on the occasion of being presented
with one of his works on natural history.</p>

<p>To the general reader the name of Lamarck is chiefly interesting
on account of his theory of the origin of life and of the diversities
of animal forms. The idea, which appears to have been favoured
by Buffon before him, that species were not through all time
unalterable, and that the more complex might have been
developed from pre-existent simpler forms, became with Lamarck
a belief or, as he imagined, a demonstration. Spontaneous
generation, he considered, might be easily conceived as resulting
from such agencies as heat and electricity causing in small
gelatinous bodies an utricular structure, and inducing a &ldquo;singular
tension,&rdquo; a kind of &ldquo;éréthisme&rdquo; or &ldquo;orgasme&rdquo;; and, having
thus accounted for the first appearance of life, he explained
the whole organization of animals and formation of different
organs by four laws (introduction to his <i>Histoire naturelle des
animaux sans vertèbres</i>, 1815):&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. &ldquo;Life by its proper forces tends continually to increase the
volume of every body possessing it, and to enlarge its parts, up to
a limit which it brings about.</p>

<p>2. &ldquo;The production of a new organ in an animal body results from
the supervention of a new want (<i>besoin</i>) continuing to make itself
felt, and a new movement which this want gives birth to and encourages.</p>

<p>3. &ldquo;The development of organs and their force of action are constantly
in ratio to the employment of these organs.</p>

<p>4. &ldquo;All which has been acquired, laid down, or changed in the
organization of individuals in the course of their life is conserved
by generation and transmitted to the new individuals which proceed
from those which have undergone those changes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The second law is often referred to as Lamarck&rsquo;s hypothesis of
the evolution of organs in animals by appetence or longing,
although he does not teach that the animal&rsquo;s desires affect its
conformation directly, but that altered wants lead to altered
habits, which result in the formation of new organs as well as
in modification, growth or dwindling of those previously existing.
Thus, he suggests that, ruminants being pursued by carnivora,
their legs have grown slender; and, their legs being only fit
for support, while their jaws are weak, they have made attack
with the crown of the head, and the determination of fluids
thither has led to the growth of horns. So also the stretching
of the giraffe&rsquo;s neck to reach the foliage he supposes to have led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
to its elongation; and the kangaroo, sitting upright to support
the young in its pouch, he imagines to have had its fore-limbs
dwarfed by disuse, and its hind legs and tail exaggerated by
using them in leaping. The fourth law expresses the inheritance
of acquired characters, which is denied by August Weismann
and his followers. For a more detailed account of Lamarck&rsquo;s
place in the history of the doctrine of evolution, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Evolution</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA MARGHERITA, CLEMENTE SOLARO,<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count del</span> (1792-1869),
Piedmontese statesman, was born at Mondovi. He studied
law at Siena and Turin, but Piedmont was at that time under
French domination, and being devoted to the house of Savoy
he refused to take his degree, as this proceeding would have
obliged him to recognize the authority of the usurper; after the
restoration of the Sardinian kingdom, however, he graduated.
In 1816 he entered the diplomatic service. Later he returned
to Turin, and succeeded in gaining the confidence and esteem
of King Charles Albert, who in 1835 appointed him minister of
foreign affairs. A fervent Roman Catholic, devoted to the pope
and to the Jesuits, friendly to Austria and firmly attached to
the principles of autocracy, he strongly opposed every attempt
at political innovation, and was in consequence bitterly hated
by the liberals. When the popular agitation in favour of constitutional
reform first broke out the king felt obliged to dispense
with La Margherita&rsquo;s services, although he had conducted public
affairs with considerable ability and absolute loyalty, even
upholding the dignity of the kingdom in the face of the arrogant
attitude of the cabinet of Vienna. He expounded his political
creed and his policy as minister to Charles Albert (from February
1835 to October 1847) in his <i>Memorandum storico-politico</i>,
published in 1851, a document of great interest for the study of
the conditions of Piedmont and Italy at that time. In 1853 he
was elected deputy for San Quirico, but he persisted in regarding
his mandate as derived from the royal authority rather than
as an emanation of the popular will. As leader of the Clerical
Right in the parliament he strongly opposed Cavour&rsquo;s policy,
which was eventually to lead to Italian unity, and on the establishment
of the kingdom of Italy he retired from public life.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA MARMORA, ALFONSO FERRERO<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> (1804-1878), Italian
general and statesman, was born at Turin on the 18th of
November 1804. He entered the Sardinian army in 1823, and
was a captain in March 1848, when he gained distinction and
the rank of major at the siege of Peschiera. On the 5th of August
1848 he liberated Charles Albert, king of Sardinia, from the
Milan revolutionaries, and in October was promoted general
and appointed minister of war. After suppressing the revolt of
Genoa in 1849, he again assumed in November 1849 the portfolio
of war, which, save during the period of his command of the
Crimean expedition, he retained until 1859. Having reconstructed
the Piedmontese army, he took part in the war of 1859
against Austria; and in July of that year succeeded Cavour in
the premiership. In 1860 he was sent to Berlin and St Petersburg
to arrange for the recognition of the kingdom of Italy,
and subsequently he held the offices of governor of Milan and
royal lieutenant at Naples, until, in September 1864, he succeeded
Minghetti as premier. In this capacity he modified the scope
of the September Convention by a note in which he claimed
for Italy full freedom of action in respect of national aspirations
to the possession of Rome, a document of which Visconti Venosta
afterwards took advantage when justifying the Italian occupation
of Rome in 1870. In April 1866 La Marmora concluded an
alliance with Prussia against Austria, and, on the outbreak of
war in June, took command of an army corps, but was defeated
at Custozza on the 23rd of June. Accused of treason by his fellow-countrymen,
and of duplicity by the Prussians, he eventually
published in defence of his tactics (1873) a series of documents
entitled <i>Un po&rsquo; più di luce sugli eventi dell&rsquo; anno</i> 1866 (More
light on the events of 1866) a step which caused irritation in
Germany, and exposed him to the charge of having violated
state secrets. Meanwhile he had been sent to Paris in 1867 to
oppose the French expedition to Rome, and in 1870, after the
occupation of Rome by the Italians, had been appointed lieutenant-royal
of the new capital. He died at Florence on the 5th
of January 1878. La Marmora&rsquo;s writings include <i>Un episodio
del risorgimento italiano</i> (Florence, 1875); and <i>I segreti di
stato nel governo constituzionale</i> (Florence, 1877).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMARTINE, ALPHONSE MARIE LOUIS DE PRAT DE<a name="ar187" id="ar187"></a></span>
(1790-1869), French poet, historian and statesman, was born at
Mâcon on the 21st of October 1790. The order of his surnames
is a controversial matter, and they are sometimes reversed.
The family of Lamartine was good, and the title of Prat was
taken from an estate in Franche Comté. His father was imprisoned
during the Terror, and only released owing to the events
of the 9th Thermidor. Lamartine&rsquo;s early education was received
from his mother. He was sent to school at Lyons in 1805, but
not being happy there was transferred to the care of the Pères de
la Foi at Belley, where he remained until 1809. For some time
afterwards he lived at home, reading romantic and poetical
literature, but in 1811 he set out for Italy, where he seems to
have sojourned nearly two years. His family having been steady
royalists, he entered the Gardes du corps at the return of the
Bourbons, and during the Hundred Days he sought refuge first in
Switzerland and then at Aix-en-Savoie, where he fell in love, with
abundant results of the poetical kind. After Waterloo he returned
to Paris. In 1818-1819 he revisited Switzerland, Savoy
and Italy, the death of his beloved affording him new subjects
for verse. After some difficulties he had his first book, the
<i>Méditations, poétiques et religieuses</i>, published (1820). It was
exceedingly popular, and helped him to make a position. He
had left the army for some time; he now entered the diplomatic
service and was appointed secretary to the embassy at Naples.
On his way to his post he married, in 1823, at Geneva a young
English lady, Marianne Birch, who had both money and beauty,
and in the same year his <i>Nouvelles méditations poétiques</i> appeared.</p>

<p>In 1824 he was transferred to Florence, where he remained five
years. His <i>Last Canto of Childe Harold</i> appeared in 1825, and
he had to fight a duel (in which he was wounded) with an Italian
officer, Colonel Pepe, in consequence of a phrase in it. Charles X.,
on whose coronation he wrote a poem, gave him the order of the
Legion of Honour. The <i>Harmonies poétiques et religieuses</i>
appeared in 1829, when he had left Florence. Having refused
an appointment in Paris under the Polignac ministry, he went on
a special mission to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. In the same
year he was elected to the Academy. Lamartine was in Switzerland,
not in Paris, at the time of the Revolution of July, and,
though he put forth a pamphlet on &ldquo;Rational Policy,&rdquo; he
did not at that crisis take any active part in politics, refusing,
however, to continue his diplomatic services under the new
government. In 1832 he set out with his wife and daughter for
Palestine, having been unsuccessful in his candidature for a seat
in the chamber. His daughter Julia died at Beirut, and before
long he received the news of his election by a constituency
(Bergues) in the department of the Nord. He returned through
Turkey and Germany, and made his first speech shortly after
the beginning of 1834. Thereafter he spoke constantly, and
acquired considerable reputation as an orator,&mdash;bringing out,
moreover, many books in prose and verse. His Eastern travels
(<i>Voyage en Orient</i>) appeared in 1835, his <i>Chute d&rsquo;un ange</i> and
<i>Jocelyn</i> in 1837, and his <i>Recueillements</i>, the last remarkable
volume of his poetry, in 1839. As the reign of Louis Philippe
went on, Lamartine, who had previously been a liberal royalist,
something after the fashion of Chateaubriand, became more and
more democratic in his opinions. He set about his greatest
prose work, the <i>Histoire des Girondins</i>, which at first appeared
periodically, and was published as a whole in 1847. Like many
other French histories, it was a pamphlet as well as a chronicle,
and the subjects of Lamartine&rsquo;s pen became his models in
politics.</p>

<p>At the revolution of February Lamartine was one of the first
to declare for a provisional government, and became a member
of it, with the post of minister for foreign affairs. He was elected
for the new constituent assembly in ten different departments,
and was chosen one of the five members of the Executive Committee.
For a few months indeed Lamartine, from being a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
distinguished man of letters, an official of inferior rank in diplomacy,
and an eloquent but unpractical speaker in parliament,
became one of the foremost men in Europe. His inexperience
in the routine work of government, the utterly unpractical
nature of his colleagues, and the turbulence of the Parisian mob,
proved fatal to his chances. He gave some proofs of statesmanlike
ability, and his eloquence was repeatedly called into requisition
to pacify the Parisians. But no one can permanently
carry on the government of a great country by speeches from the
balcony of a house in the capital, and Lamartine found himself
in a dilemma. So long as he held aloof from Ledru-Rollin and
the more radical of his colleagues, the disunion resulting
weakened the government; as soon as he effected an approximation
to them the middle classes fell off from him. The quelling
of the insurrection of the 15th of May was his last successful
act. A month later the renewal of active disturbances brought
on the fighting of June, and Lamartine&rsquo;s influence was extinguished
in favour of Cavaignac. Moreover, his chance of renewed
political pre-eminence was gone. He had been tried and found
wanting, having neither the virtues nor the vices of his situation.
In January 1849, though he was nominated for the presidency,
only a few thousand votes were given to him, and three
months later he was not even elected to the Legislative
Assembly.</p>

<p>The remaining story of Lamartine&rsquo;s life is somewhat melancholy.
He had never been a rich man, nor had he been a saving one, and
during his period of popularity and office he had incurred great
expenses. He now set to work to repair his fortune by unremitting
literary labour. He brought out in the <i>Presse</i> (1849) a
series of <i>Confidences</i>, and somewhat later a kind of autobiography,
entitled <i>Raphael</i>. He wrote several historical works of more or
less importance, the <i>History of the Revolution of 1848</i>, <i>The
History of the Restoration</i>, <i>The History of Turkey</i>, <i>The History
of Russia</i>, besides a large number of small biographical and
miscellaneous works. In 1858 a subscription was opened for
his benefit. Two years afterwards, following the example of
Chateaubriand, he supervised an elaborate edition of his own
works in forty-one volumes. This occupied five years, and while
he was engaged on it his wife died (1863). He was now over
seventy; his powers had deserted him, and even if they had not
the public taste had entirely changed. His efforts had not
succeeded in placing him in a position of independence; and at
last, in 1867, the government of the Empire (from which he had
perforce stood aloof, though he never considered it necessary to
adopt the active protesting attitude of Edgar Quinet and Victor
Hugo) came to his assistance, a vote of £20,000 being proposed
in April of that year for his benefit by Émile Ollivier. This was
creditable to both parties, for Lamartine, both as a distinguished
man of letters and as a past servant of the state, had every
claim to the bounty of his country. But he was reproached for
accepting it by the extreme republicans and irreconcilables.
He did not enjoy it long, dying on the 28th of February
1869.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As a statesman Lamartine was placed during his brief tenure of
office in a position from which it would have been almost impossible
for any man, who was not prepared and able to play the dictator,
to emerge with credit. At no time in history were unpractical
crotchets so rife in the heads of men as in 1848. But Lamartine
could hardly have guided the ship of state safely even in much
calmer weather. He was amiable and even estimable, the chief fault
of his character being vanity and an incurable tendency towards
theatrical effect, which makes his travels, memoirs and other personal
records as well as his historical works radically untrustworthy. Nor
does it appear that he had any settled political ideas. He did good
by moderating the revolutionary and destructive ardour of the
Parisian populace in 1848; but he had been perhaps more responsible
than any other single person for bringing about the events of that
year by the vague and frothy republican declamation of his <i>Histoire
des Girondins</i>.</p>

<p>More must be said of his literary position. Lamartine had the advantage
of coming at a time when the literary field, at least in the
departments of belles lettres, was almost empty. The feeble school
of descriptive writers, epic poets of the extreme decadence, fabulists
and miscellaneous verse-makers, which the Empire had nourished
could satisfy no one. Madame de Staël was dead; Chateaubriand,
though alive, was something of a classic, and had not effected a full
revolution. Lamartine did not himself go the complete length of the
Romantic revival, but he went far in that direction. He availed
himself of the reviving interest in legitimism and Catholicism which
was represented by Bonald and Joseph de Maistre, of the nature
worship of Rousseau and Bernardin de Saint Pierre, of the sentimentalism
of Madame de Staël, of the medievalism and the romance
of Chateaubriand and Scott, of the <i>maladie du siècle</i> of Chateaubriand
and Byron. Perhaps if his matter be very closely analysed it will be
found that he added hardly anything of his own. But if the parts of
the mixture were like other things the mixture itself was not. It
seemed indeed to the immediate generation so original that tradition
has it that the <i>Méditations</i> were refused by a publisher because they
were in none of the accepted styles. They appeared when Lamartine
was nearly thirty years old. The best of them, and the best thing
that Lamartine ever did, is the famous <i>Lac</i>, describing his return to
the little mountain tarn of Le Bourget after the death of his mistress,
with whom he had visited it in other days. The verse is exquisitely
harmonious, the sentiments conventional but refined and delicate,
the imagery well chosen and gracefully expressed. There is an unquestionable
want of vigour, but to readers of that day the want of
vigour was entirely compensated by the presence of freshness and
grace. Lamartine&rsquo;s chief misfortune in poetry was not only that his
note was a somewhat weak one, but that he could strike but one.
The four volumes of the <i>Méditations</i>, the <i>Harmonies</i> and the <i>Recueillements</i>,
which contained the prime of his verse, are perhaps the most
monotonous reading to be found anywhere in work of equal bulk by
a poet of equal talent. They contain nothing but meditative lyrical
pieces, almost any one of which is typical of the whole, though there is
considerable variation of merit. The two narrative poems which
succeeded the early lyrics, <i>Jocelyn</i> and the <i>Chute d&rsquo;un ange</i>, were,
according to Lamartine&rsquo;s original plan, parts of a vast &ldquo;Epic of the
Ages,&rdquo; some further fragments of which survive. <i>Jocelyn</i> had at one
time more popularity in England than most French verse. <i>La Chute
d&rsquo;un ange</i>, in which the Byronic influence is more obvious than in
any other of Lamartine&rsquo;s works, and in which some have also seen
that of Alfred de Vigny, is more ambitious in theme, and less regulated
by scrupulous conditions of delicacy in handling, than most of
its author&rsquo;s poetry. It does, however, little more than prove that
such audacities were not for him.</p>

<p>As a prose writer Lamartine was very fertile. His characteristics
in his prose fiction and descriptive work are not very different from
those of his poetry. He is always and everywhere sentimental,
though very frequently, as in his shorter prose tales (<i>The Stone
Mason of Saint-Point</i>, <i>Graziella</i>, &amp;c.), he is graceful as well as
sentimental. In his histories the effect is worse. It has been
hinted that Lamartine&rsquo;s personal narratives are doubtfully trustworthy;
with regard to his Eastern travels some of the episodes
were stigmatized as mere inventions. In his histories proper the
special motive for embellishment disappears, but the habit of inaccuracy
remains. As an historian he belongs exclusively to the
rhetorical school as distinguished from the philosophical on the one
hand and the documentary on the other.</p>

<p>It is not surprising when these characteristics of Lamartine&rsquo;s work
are appreciated to find that his fame declined with singular rapidity
in France. As a poet he had lost his reputation many years before
he died. He was entirely eclipsed by the brilliant and vigorous
school who succeeded him with Victor Hugo at their head. His
power of initiative in poetry was very small, and the range of poetic
ground which he could cover strictly limited. He could only carry
the picturesque sentimentalism of Rousseau, Bernardin de Saint
Pierre and Chateaubriand a little farther, and clothe it in language
and verse a little less antiquated than that of Chênedollé and Millevoye.
He has been said to be a French Cowper, and the parallel holds
good in respect of versification and of his relative position to the
more daringly innovating school that followed, though not in respect
of individual peculiarities. Lamartine in short occupied a kind of
half-way house between the 18th century and the Romantic movement,
and he never got any farther. When Matthew Arnold
questioned his importance in conversation with Sainte-Beuve, the
answer was, &ldquo;He is important to <i>us</i>,&rdquo; and it was a true answer; but
the limitation is obvious. In more recent years, however, efforts
have been made by Brunetière and others to remove it. The usual
revolution of critical as of other taste, the oblivion of personal and
political unpopularity, and above all the reaction against Hugo and
the extreme Romantics, have been the main agents in this. Lamartine
has been extolled as a pattern of combined passion and
restraint, as a model of nobility of sentiment, and as a harmonizer of
pure French classicism in taste and expression with much, if not all,
the better part of Romanticism itself. These oscillations of opinion
are frequent, if not universal, and it is only after more than one or two
swings that the pendulum remains at the perpendicular. The above
remarks are an attempt to correct extravagance in either direction.
But it is difficult to believe that Lamartine can ever permanently
take rank among the first order of poets.</p>

<p>The edition mentioned is the most complete one of Lamartine, but
there are many issues of his separate works. After his death some
poems and <i>Mémoires inédits</i> of his youth were published, and also
two volumes of correspondence, while in 1893 Mlle V. de Lamartine
added a volume of <i>Lettres</i> to him. The change of views above referred
to may be studied in the detached articles of MM. Brunetière,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
Faguet, Lemaître, &amp;c., and in the more substantive work of Ch. de
Pomairols, <i>Lamartine</i> (1889); E. Deschanel, <i>Lamartine</i> (1893);
E. Zyrowski, <i>Lamartine</i> (1896); and perhaps best of all in the
Preface to Emile Legouis&rsquo; Clarendon Press edition of <i>Jocelyn</i> (1906),
where a vigorous effort is made to combat the idea of Lamartine&rsquo;s
sentimentality and femininity as a poet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMB, CHARLES<a name="ar188" id="ar188"></a></span> (1775-1834), English essayist and critic,
was born in Crown Office Row, Inner Temple, London, on the
10th of February 1775. His father, John Lamb, a Lincolnshire
man, who filled the situation of clerk and servant-companion
to Samuel Salt, a member of parliament and one of the benchers
of the Inner Temple, was successful in obtaining for Charles,
the youngest of three surviving children, a presentation to
Christ&rsquo;s Hospital, where the boy remained from his eighth to
his fifteenth year (1782-1789). Here he had for a schoolfellow
Samuel Taylor Coleridge, his senior by rather more than two
years, and a close and tender friendship began which lasted for
the rest of the lives of both. When the time came for leaving
school, where he had learned some Greek and acquired considerable
facility in Latin composition, Lamb, after a brief stay at
home (probably spent, as his school holidays had often been,
over old English authors in Salt&rsquo;s library) was condemned to the
labours of the desk&mdash;&ldquo;an inconquerable impediment&rdquo; in his
speech disqualifying him for the clerical profession, which, as
the school exhibitions were usually only given to those preparing
for the church, thus deprived him of the only means by which
he could have obtained a university education. For a short
time he was in the office of Joseph Paice, a London merchant,
and then for twenty-three weeks, until the 8th of February 1792,
he held a small post in the Examiner&rsquo;s Office of the South Sea
House, where his brother John was established, a period which,
although his age was but sixteen, was to provide him nearly
thirty years later with materials for the first of the <i>Essays of
Elia</i>. On the 5th of April 1792, he entered the Accountant&rsquo;s
Office in the East India House, where during the next three and
thirty years the hundred official folios of what he used to call
his true &ldquo;works&rdquo; were produced.</p>

<p>Of the years 1792-1795 we know little. At the end of 1794
he saw much of Coleridge and joined him in writing sonnets in
the <i>Morning Post</i>, addressed to eminent persons: early in
1795 he met Southey and was much in the company of James
White, whom he probably helped in the composition of the
<i>Original Letters of Sir John Falstaff</i>; and at the end of the year
for a short time he became so unhinged mentally as to necessitate
confinement in an asylum. The cause, it is probable, was an
unsuccessful love affair with Ann Simmons, the Hertfordshire
maiden to whom his first sonnets are addressed, whom he would
have seen when on his visits as a youth to Blakesware House,
near Widford, the country home of the Plumer family, of which
Lamb&rsquo;s grandmother, Mary Field, was for many years, until
her death in 1792, sole custodian.</p>

<p>It was in the late summer of 1796 that a dreadful calamity
came upon the Lambs, which seemed to blight all Lamb&rsquo;s
prospects in the very morning of life. On the 22nd of September
his sister Mary, &ldquo;worn down to a state of extreme nervous
misery by attention to needlework by day and to her mother
at night,&rdquo; was suddenly seized with acute mania, in which she
stabbed her mother to the heart. The calm self-mastery and
loving self-renunciation which Charles Lamb, by constitution
excitable, nervous and self-mistrustful, displayed at this crisis
in his own history and in that of those nearest him, will ever
give him an imperishable claim to the reverence and affection of
all who are capable of appreciating the heroisms of common
life. With the help of friends he succeeded in obtaining his
sister&rsquo;s release from the lifelong restraint to which she would
otherwise have been doomed, on the express condition that he
himself should undertake the responsibility for her safe keeping.
It proved no light charge: for though no one was capable of
affording a more intelligent or affectionate companionship than
Mary Lamb during her periods of health, there was ever present
the apprehension of the recurrence of her malady; and when
from time to time the premonitory symptoms had become
unmistakable, there was no alternative but her removal, which
took place in quietness and tears. How deeply the whole course
of Lamb&rsquo;s domestic life must have been affected by his singular
loyalty as a brother needs not to be pointed out.</p>

<p>Lamb&rsquo;s first appearance as an author was made in the year
of the great tragedy of his life (1796), when there were published
in the volume of <i>Poems on Various Subjects</i> by Coleridge four
sonnets by &ldquo;Mr Charles Lamb of the India House.&rdquo; In the
following year he contributed, with Charles Lloyd, a pupil of
Coleridge, some pieces in blank verse to the second edition of
Coleridge&rsquo;s <i>Poems</i>. In 1797 his short summer holiday was
spent with Coleridge at Nether Stowey, where he met the
Wordsworths, William and Dorothy, and established a friendship
with both which only his own death terminated. In 1798, under
the influence of Henry Mackenzie&rsquo;s novel <i>Julie de Roubigné</i>,
he published a short and pathetic prose tale entitled <i>Rosamund
Gray</i>, in which it is possible to trace beneath disguised conditions
references to the misfortunes of the author&rsquo;s own family, and
many personal touches; and in the same year he joined Lloyd
in a volume of <i>Blank Verse</i>, to which Lamb contributed poems
occasioned by the death of his mother and his aunt Sarah Lamb,
among them being his best-known lyric, &ldquo;The Old Familiar
Faces.&rdquo; In this year, 1798, he achieved the unexpected publicity
of an attack by the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> upon him as an associate of
Coleridge and Southey (to whose <i>Annual Anthology</i> he had
contributed) in their Jacobin machinations. In 1799, on the
death of her father, Mary Lamb came to live again with her
brother, their home then being in Pentonville; but it was not
until 1800 that they really settled together, their first independent
joint home being at Mitre Court Buildings in the Temple, where
they lived until 1809. At the end of 1801, or beginning of 1802,
appeared Lamb&rsquo;s first play <i>John Woodvil</i>, on which he set great
store, a slight dramatic piece written in the style of the earlier
Elizabethan period and containing some genuine poetry and
happy delineation of the gentler emotions, but as a whole
deficient in plot, vigour and character; it was held up to ridicule
by the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> as a specimen of the rudest condition
of the drama, a work by &ldquo;a man of the age of Thespis.&rdquo; The
dramatic spirit, however, was not thus easily quenched in Lamb,
and his next effort was a farce, <i>Mr H&mdash;&mdash;</i>, the point of which lay
in the hero&rsquo;s anxiety to conceal his name &ldquo;Hogsflesh&rdquo;; but
it did not survive the first night of its appearance at Drury
Lane, in December 1806. Its author bore the failure with rare
equanimity and good humour&mdash;even to joining in the hissing&mdash;and
soon struck into new and more successful fields of literary
exertion. Before, however, passing to these it should be mentioned
that he made various efforts to earn money by journalism,
partly by humorous articles, partly as dramatic critic, but
chiefly as a contributor of sarcastic or funny paragraphs, &ldquo;sparing
neither man nor woman,&rdquo; in the <i>Morning Post</i>, principally in
1803.</p>

<p>In 1807 appeared <i>Tales founded on the Plays of Shakespeare</i>,
written by Charles and Mary Lamb, in which Charles was
responsible for the tragedies and Mary for the comedies; and
in 1808, <i>Specimens of English Dramatic Poets who lived about
the time of Shakespeare</i>, with short but felicitous critical notes.
It was this work which laid the foundation of Lamb&rsquo;s reputation
as a critic, for it was filled with imaginative understanding of
the old playwrights, and a warm, discerning and novel appreciation
of their great merits. In the same year, 1808, Mary Lamb,
assisted by her brother, published <i>Poetry for Children</i>, and a
collection of short school-girl tales under the title <i>Mrs
Leicester&rsquo;s School</i>; and to the same date belongs <i>The Adventures
of Ulysses</i>, designed by Lamb as a companion to <i>The Adventures
of Telemachus</i>. In 1810 began to appear Leigh Hunt&rsquo;s quarterly
periodical, <i>The Reflector</i>, in which Lamb published much (including
the fine essays on the tragedies of Shakespeare and on
Hogarth) that subsequently appeared in the first collective
edition of his <i>Works</i>, which he put forth in 1818.</p>

<p>Between 1811, when <i>The Reflector</i> ceased, and 1820, he wrote
almost nothing. In these years we may imagine him at his
most social period, playing much whist and entertaining his
friends on Wednesday or Thursday nights; meanwhile gathering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
that reputation as a conversationalist or inspirer of conversation
in others, which Hazlitt, who was at one time one of Lamb&rsquo;s
closest friends, has done so much to celebrate. When in 1818 appeared
the <i>Works</i> in two volumes, it may be that Lamb considered
his literary career over. Before coming to 1820, and an event
which was in reality to be the beginning of that career as it is
generally known&mdash;the establishment of the <i>London Magazine</i>&mdash;it
should be recorded that in the summer of 1819 Lamb, with his
sister&rsquo;s full consent, proposed marriage to Fanny Kelly, the
actress, who was then in her thirtieth year. Miss Kelly could
not accept, giving as one reason her devotion to her mother.
Lamb bore the rebuff with characteristic humour and fortitude.</p>

<p>The establishment of the <i>London Magazine</i> in 1820 stimulated
Lamb to the production of a series of new essays (the <i>Essays
of Elia</i>) which may be said to form the chief corner-stone in
the small but classic temple of his fame. The first of these,
as it fell out, was a description of the old South Sea House,
with which Lamb happened to have associated the name of a
&ldquo;gay light-hearted foreigner&rdquo; called Elia, who was a clerk in
the days of his service there. The pseudonym adopted on this
occasion was retained for the subsequent contributions, which
appeared collectively in a volume of essays called <i>Elia</i>, in 1823.
After a career of five years the <i>London Magazine</i> came to an
end; and about the same period Lamb&rsquo;s long connexion with
the India House terminated, a pension of £450 (£441 net) having
been assigned to him. The increased leisure, however, for which
he had long sighed, did not prove favourable to literary production,
which henceforth was limited to a few trifling contributions
to the <i>New Monthly</i> and other serials, and the excavation
of gems from the mass of dramatic literature bequeathed to the
British Museum by David Garrick, which Lamb laboriously
read through in 1827, an occupation which supplied him for a
time with the regular hours of work he missed so much. The
malady of his sister, which continued to increase with ever
shortening intervals of relief, broke in painfully on his lettered
ease and comfort; and it is unfortunately impossible to ignore
the deteriorating effects of an over-free indulgence in the use
of alcohol, and, in early life, tobacco, on a temperament such as
his. His removal on account of his sister to the quiet of the
country at Enfield, by tending to withdraw him from the
stimulating society of the large circle of literary friends who
had helped to make his weekly or monthly &ldquo;at homes&rdquo; so
remarkable, doubtless also tended to intensify his listlessness
and helplessness. One of the brightest elements in the closing
years of his life was the friendship and companionship of Emma
Isola, whom he and his sister had adopted, and whose marriage
in 1833 to Edward Moxon, the publisher, though a source of
unselfish joy to Lamb, left him more than ever alone. While
living at Edmonton, whither he had moved in 1833 so that his
sister might have the continual care of Mr and Mrs Walden,
who were accustomed to patients of weak intellect, Lamb was
overtaken by an attack of erysipelas brought on by an accidental
fall as he was walking on the London road. After a few days&rsquo;
illness he died on the 27th of December, 1834. The sudden death
of one so widely known, admired and beloved, fell on the public
as well as on his own attached circle with all the poignancy of
a personal calamity and a private grief. His memory wanted
no tribute that affection could bestow, and Wordsworth commemorated
in simple and solemn verse the genius, virtues and
fraternal devotion of his early friend.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb is entitled to a place as an essayist beside
Montaigne, Sir Thomas Browne, Steele and Addison. He unites
many of the characteristics of each of these writers&mdash;refined and
exquisite humour, a genuine and cordial vein of pleasantry and
heart-touching pathos. His fancy is distinguished by great delicacy
and tenderness; and even his conceits are imbued with human
feeling and passion. He had an extreme and almost exclusive
partiality for earlier prose writers, particularly for Fuller,
Browne and Burton, as well as for the dramatists of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
time; and the care with which he studied them is
apparent in all he ever wrote. It shines out conspicuously in
his style, which has an antique air and is redolent of the
peculiarities of the 17th century. Its quaintness has subjected
the author to the charge of affectation, but there is nothing really
affected in his writings. His style is not so much an imitation
as a reflexion of the older writers; for in spirit he made himself
their contemporary. A confirmed habit of studying them in
preference to modern literature had made something of their
style natural to him; and long experience had rendered it not
only easy and familiar but habitual. It was not a masquerade
dress he wore, but the costume which showed the man to most
advantage. With thought and meaning often profound, though
clothed in simple language, every sentence of his essays is
pregnant.</p>

<p>He played a considerable part in reviving the dramatic
writers of the Shakesperian age; for he preceded Gifford and
others in wiping the dust of ages from their works. In his
brief comments on each specimen he displays exquisite powers
of discrimination: his discernment of the true meaning of his
author is almost infallible. His work was a departure in criticism.
Former editors had supplied textual criticism and alternative
readings: Lamb&rsquo;s object was to show how our ancestors felt
when they placed themselves by the power of imagination in
trying situations, in the conflicts of duty or passion or the strife
of contending duties; what sorts of loves and enmities theirs
were.</p>

<p>As a poet Lamb is not entitled to so high a place as that which
can be claimed for him as essayist and critic. His dependence
on Elizabethan models is here also manifest, but in such a way
as to bring into all the greater prominence his native deficiency
in &ldquo;the accomplishment of verse.&rdquo; Yet it is impossible, once
having read, ever to forget the tenderness and grace of such
poems as &ldquo;Hester,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Old Familiar Faces,&rdquo; and the lines
&ldquo;On an infant dying as soon as born&rdquo; or the quaint humour of
&ldquo;A Farewell to Tobacco.&rdquo; As a letter writer Lamb ranks very
high, and when in a nonsensical mood there is none to touch
him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMB<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> (a word common to Teutonic languages; cf. Ger. <i>Lamm</i>),
the young of sheep. The Paschal Lamb or Agnus Dei is used as a
symbol of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God (John i. 29), and
&ldquo;lamb,&rdquo; like &ldquo;flock,&rdquo; is often used figuratively of the members
of a Christian church or community, with an allusion to Jesus&rsquo;
charge to Peter (John xxi. 15). The &ldquo;lamb and flag&rdquo; is an
heraldic emblem, the dexter fore-leg of the lamb supporting a
staff bearing a banner charged with the St George&rsquo;s cross. This
was one of the crests of the Knights Templars, used on seals as
early as 1241; it was adopted as a badge or crest by the Middle
Temple, the Inner Temple using another crest of the Templars,
the winged horse or Pegasus. The old Tangier regiment, now
the Queen&rsquo;s Royal West Surrey Regiment, bore a Paschal Lamb
as its badge. From their colonel, Percy Kirke (<i>q.v.</i>), they were
known as Kirke&rsquo;s Lambs. The exaggerated reputation of the
regiment for brutality, both in Tangier and in England after
Sedgmoor, lent irony to the nickname.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMBALLE, MARIE THÉRÈSE LOUISE OF SAVOY-CARIGNANO<a name="ar190" id="ar190"></a></span>,
<span class="sc">Princesse de</span> (1749-1792), fourth daughter of
Louis Victor of Carignano (d. 1774) (great-grandfather of King
Charles Albert of Sardinia), and of Christine Henriette of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rothenburg,
was born at Turin on the 8th of September
1749. In 1767 she was married to Louis Alexandre Stanislaus de
Bourbon, prince of Lamballe, son of the duke of Penthièvre, a
grandson of Louis XIV.&rsquo;s natural son the count of Toulouse. Her
husband dying the following year, she retired with her father-in-law
to Rambouillet, where she lived until the marriage of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
dauphin, when she returned to court. Marie Antoinette,
charmed by her gentle and naïve manners, singled her out for
a companion and confidante. The impetuous character of the
dauphiness found in Madame de Lamballe that submissive
temperament which yields to force of environment, and the two
became fast friends. After her accession Marie Antoinette, in
spite of the king&rsquo;s opposition, had her appointed superintendent
of the royal household. Between 1776 and 1785 the comtesse de
Polignac succeeded in supplanting her; but when the queen
tired of the avarice of the Polignacs, she turned again to Madame
de Lamballe. From 1785 to the Revolution she was Marie
Antoinette&rsquo;s closest friend and the pliant instrument of her
caprices. She came with the queen to the Tuileries and as her
salon served as a meeting-place for the queen and the members
of the Assembly whom she wished to gain over, the people believed
her to be the soul of all the intrigues. After a visit to England in
1791 to appeal for help for the royal family she made her will
and returned to the Tuileries, where she continued her services
to the queen until the 10th of August, when she shared her
imprisonment in the Temple. On the 19th of August she was
transferred to La Force, and having refused to take the oath
against the monarchy, she was on the 3rd of September delivered
over to the fury of the populace, after which her head was
placed on a pike and carried before the windows of the queen.</p>

Belgian sculptor, was born at Antwerp. He studied at the
Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts, and was a pupil of Jean Geefs.
His first work, &ldquo;War,&rdquo; was exhibited in 1871, and was followed
by a long series of humorous groups, including &ldquo;Children

executed for the Belgian salons &ldquo;The Beggar&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Blind
Pauper,&rdquo; and produced &ldquo;The Kiss&rdquo; (1881), generally regarded
as his masterpiece. After visiting Italy, where he was much

<p><span class="bold">LAMBERMONT, AUGUSTE<a name="ar194" id="ar194"></a></span>, <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1819-1905), Belgian
statesman, was born at Dion-le-Val in Brabant on the 25th of
March 1819. He came of a family of small farmer proprietors,
who had held land during three centuries. He was intended for
the priesthood and entered the seminary of Floreffe, but his
energies claimed a more active sphere. He left the monastery for
Louvain University. Here he studied law, and also prepared
himself for the military examinations. At that juncture the
first Carlist war broke out, and Lambermont hastened to the
scene of action. His services were accepted (April 1838) and he
was entrusted with the command of two small cannon. He also
acted as A.D.C. to Colonel Durando. He greatly distinguished
himself, and for his intrepidity on one occasion he was decorated
with the Cross of the highest military Order of St Ferdinand.
Returning to Belgium he entered the Ministry for Foreign
Affairs in 1842. He served in this department sixty-three years.
He was closely associated with several of the most important
questions in Belgian history during the last half of the 19th
century&mdash;notably the freeing of the Scheldt. He was one of the
very first Belgians to see the importance of developing the trade
of their country, and at his own request he was attached to the
commercial branch of the foreign office. The tolls imposed by the
Dutch on navigation on the Scheldt strangled Belgian trade, for
Antwerp was the only port of the country. The Dutch had the
right to make this levy under treaties going back to the treaty of
Munster in 1648, and they clung to it still more tenaciously after
Belgium separated herself in 1830-1831 from the united kingdom
of the Netherlands&mdash;the London conference in 1839 fixing the
toll payable to Holland at 1.50 florins (3s.) per ton. From 1856 to
1863 Lambermont devoted most of his energies to the removal of
this impediment. In 1856 he drew up a plan of action, and he
prosecuted it with untiring perseverance until he saw it embodied
in an international convention seven years later. Twenty-one
powers and states attended a conference held on the question at
Brussels in 1863, and on the 15th of July the treaty freeing the
Scheldt was signed. For this achievement Lambermont was
made a baron. Among other important conferences in which
Lambermont took a leading part were those of Brussels (1874)
on the usages of war, Berlin (1884-1885) on Africa and the
Congo region, and Brussels (1890) on Central African Affairs and
the Slave Trade. He was joint reporter with Baron de Courcel
of the Berlin conference in 1884-1885, and on several occasions
he was chosen as arbitrator by one or other of the great European
powers. But his great achievement was the freeing of the Scheldt,
and in token of its gratitude the city of Antwerp erected a fine
monument to his memory. He died on the 7th of March 1905.</p>

his great size, was born near Leicester on the 13th of March
1770, the son of the keeper of the jail, to which post he succeeded
in 1791. About this time his size and weight increased enormously,
and though he had led an active and athletic life he
weighed in 1793 thirty-two stone (448 &#8468;). In 1806 he resolved
to profit by his notoriety, and resigning his office went up to
London and exhibited himself. He died on the 21st of July

was the son of a papal official at Avignon, where he was born
between 1485 and 1487. At the age of 15 he entered the
Franciscan monastery at Avignon, and after 1517 he was an
itinerant preacher, travelling through France, Italy and Switzerland.
His study of the Scriptures shook his faith in Roman
Catholic theology, and by 1522 he had abandoned his order,
and became known to the leaders of the Reformation in Switzerland
and Germany. He did not, however, identify himself
either with Zwinglianism or Lutheranism; he disputed with
Zwingli at Zürich in 1522, and then made his way to Eisenach
and Wittenberg, where he married in 1523. He returned to
Strassburg in 1524, being anxious to spread the doctrines of the
Reformation among the French-speaking population of the
neighbourhood. By the Germans he was distrusted, and in 1526
his activities were prohibited by the city of Strassburg. He was,
however, befriended by Jacob Sturm, who recommended him
to the Landgraf Philip of Hesse, the most liberal of the German
reforming princes. With Philip&rsquo;s encouragement he drafted
that scheme of ecclesiastical reform for which he is famous.
Its basis was essentially democratic and congregational, though
it provided for the government of the whole church by means of
a synod. Pastors were to be elected by the congregation, and the
whole system of canon-law was repudiated. This scheme was
submitted by Philip to a synod at Homburg; but Luther
intervened and persuaded the Landgraf to abandon it. It was
far too democratic to commend itself to the Lutherans, who had
by this time bound the Lutheran cause to the support of princes
rather than to that of the people. Philip continued to favour
Lambert, who was appointed professor and head of the theological
faculty in the Landgraf&rsquo;s new university of Marburg.
Patrick Hamilton (<i>q.v.</i>), the Scottish martyr, was one of his pupils;
and it was at Lambert&rsquo;s instigation that Hamilton composed
his <i>Loci communes</i>, or <i>Patrick&rsquo;s Pleas</i> as they were popularly
called in Scotland. Lambert was also one of the divines who
took part in the great conference of Marburg in 1529; he had
long wavered between the Lutheran and the Zwinglian view
of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, but at this conference he definitely adopted
the Zwinglian view. He died of the plague on the 18th of April
1530, and was buried at Marburg.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMBERT, JOHANN HEINRICH<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span> (1728-1777), German
physicist, mathematician and astronomer, was born at Mulhausen,
Alsace, on the 26th of August 1728. He was the son of
a tailor; and the slight elementary instruction he obtained
at the free school of his native town was supplemented by his
own private reading. He became book-keeper at Montbéliard
ironworks, and subsequently (1745) secretary to Professor Iselin,
the editor of a newspaper at Basel, who three years later recommended
him as private tutor to the family of Count A. von Salis
of Coire. Coming thus into virtual possession of a good library,
Lambert had peculiar opportunities for improving himself in his
literary and scientific studies. In 1759, after completing with
his pupils a tour of two years&rsquo; duration through Göttingen,
Utrecht, Paris, Marseilles and Turin, he resigned his tutorship
and settled at Augsburg. Munich, Erlangen, Coire and Leipzig
became for brief successive intervals his home. In 1764 he
removed to Berlin, where he received many favours at the hand
of Frederick the Great and was elected a member of the Royal
Academy of Sciences of Berlin, and in 1774 edited the Berlin
<i>Ephemeris</i>. He died of consumption on the 25th of September
1777. His publications show him to have been a man of original
and active mind with a singular facility in applying mathematics
to practical questions.</p>

<p>His mathematical discoveries were extended and overshadowed
by his contemporaries. His development of the
equation <i>x<span class="sp">m</span></i> + <i>px</i> = <i>q</i> in an infinite series was extended by Leonhard
Euler, and particularly by Joseph Louis Lagrange. In 1761
he proved the irrationality of &pi;; a simpler proof was given
somewhat later by Legendre. The introduction of hyperbolic
functions into trigonometry was also due to him. His geometrical
discoveries are of great value, his <i>Die freie Perspective</i> (1759-1774)
being a work of great merit. Astronomy was also enriched
by his investigations, and he was led to several remarkable
theorems on conics which bear his name. The most important
are: (1) To express the time of describing an elliptic arc under
the Newtonian law of gravitation in terms of the focal distances
of the initial and final points, and the length of the chord joining
them. (2) A theorem relating to the apparent curvature of the
geocentric path of a comet.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lambert&rsquo;s most important work, <i>Pyrometrie</i> (Berlin, 1779), is a
systematic treatise on heat, containing the records and full discussion
of many of his own experiments. Worthy of special notice
also are <i>Photometria</i> (Augsburg, 1760), <i>Insigniores orbitae cometarum
proprietates</i> (Augsburg, 1761), and <i>Beiträge zum Gebrauche
der Mathematik und deren Anwendung</i> (4 vols., Berlin, 1765-1772).</p>

<p>The <i>Memoirs</i> of the Berlin Academy from 1761 to 1784 contain
many of his papers, which treat of such subjects as resistance of
fluids, magnetism, comets, probabilities, the problem of three bodies,
meteorology, &amp;c. In the <i>Acta Helvetica</i> (1752-1760) and in the
<i>Nova acta erudita</i> (1763-1769) several of his contributions appear.
In Bode&rsquo;s <i>Jahrbuch</i> (1776-1780) he discusses nutation, aberration of
light, Saturn&rsquo;s rings and comets; in the <i>Nova acta Helvetica</i> (1787)
he has a long paper &ldquo;Sur le son des corps élastiques,&rdquo; in Bernoulli
and Hindenburg&rsquo;s <i>Magazin</i> (1787-1788) he treats of the roots of
equation and of parallel lines; and in Hindenburg&rsquo;s <i>Archiv</i> (1798-1799)
he writes on optics and perspective. Many of these pieces
were published posthumously. Recognized as among the first
mathematicians of his day, he was also widely known for the universality
and depth of his philological and philosophical knowledge.
The most valuable of his logical and philosophical memoirs were
published collectively in 2 vols. (1782).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMBERT<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> [<i>alias</i> <span class="sc">Nicholson</span>], <span class="bold">JOHN</span> (d. 1538), English
Protestant martyr, was born at Norwich and educated at
Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. and was admitted in 1521
a fellow of Queen&rsquo;s College on the nomination of Catherine of
Aragon. After acting for some years as a &ldquo;mass-priest,&rdquo; his
views were unsettled by the arguments of Bilney and Arthur;
and episcopal persecution compelled him, according to his own
account, to assume the name Lambert instead of Nicholson.
He likewise removed to Antwerp, where he became chaplain to
the English factory, and formed a friendship with Frith and
Tyndale. Returning to England in 1531, he came under the
notice of Archbishop Warham, who questioned him closely on
his religious beliefs. Warham&rsquo;s death in August 1532 relieved
Lambert from immediate danger, and he earned a living for some
years by teaching Latin and Greek near the Stocks Market in
London. The duke of Norfolk and other reactionaries accused
him of heresy in 1536, but reforming tendencies were still in
the ascendant, and Lambert escaped. In 1538, however, the
reaction had begun, and Lambert was its first victim. He
singled himself out for persecution by denying the Real Presence:
and Henry VIII., who had just rejected the Lutheran proposals
for a theological union, was in no mood to tolerate worse heresies.
Lambert had challenged some views expressed by Dr John
Taylor, afterwards bishop of Lincoln; and Cranmer as archbishop
condemned Lambert&rsquo;s opinions. He appealed to the king as
supreme head of the Church, and on the 16th of November Henry
heard the case in person before a large assembly of spiritual and
temporal peers. For five hours Lambert disputed with the king
and ten bishops; and then, as he boldly denied that the Eucharist
was the body of Christ, he was condemned to death by Cromwell
as vicegerent. Henry&rsquo;s condescension and patience produced
a great impression on his Catholic subjects; but Cromwell is
said by Foxe to have asked Lambert&rsquo;s pardon before his execution,
and Cranmer eventually adopted the views he condemned in
Lambert. Lambert was burnt at Smithfield on the 22nd of
November.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMBERT, JOHN<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span> (1619-1694), English general in the Great
Rebellion, was born at Calton Hall, Kirkby Malham, in the West
Riding of Yorkshire. His family was of ancient lineage, and long
settled in the county. He studied law, but did not make it his
profession. In 1639 he married Frances, daughter of Sir William
Lister. At the opening of the Civil War he took up arms for
the parliament, and in September 1642 was appointed a captain
of horse in the army commanded by Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax.
A year later he had become colonel of a regiment of horse, and
he distinguished himself at the siege of Hull in October, 1643.
Early in 1644 he did good service at the battles of Nantwich
and Bradford. At Marston Moor Lambert&rsquo;s own regiment was
routed by the charge of Goring&rsquo;s horse; but he cut his way
through with a few troops and joined Cromwell on the other side
of the field. When the New Model army was formed in the
beginning of 1645, Colonel Lambert was appointed to succeed
Fairfax in command of the northern forces. General Poyntz,
however, soon replaced him, and under this officer he served in
the Yorkshire campaign of 1645, receiving a wound before
Pontefract. In 1646 he was given a regiment in the New Model,
serving with Fairfax in the west of England, and he was a
commissioner, with Cromwell and others, for the surrender of
Oxford in the same year. &ldquo;It is evident,&rdquo; says C. H. Firth
(<i>Dict. Nat. Biog.</i>), &ldquo;that he was from the first regarded as an
officer of exceptional capacity and specially selected for semi-political
employments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the quarrel between the army and the parliament
began, Lambert threw himself warmly into the army&rsquo;s cause.
He assisted Ireton in drawing up the several addresses and
remonstrances issued by the army, both men having had some
experience in the law, and being &ldquo;of a subtle and working brain.&rdquo;
Early in August 1647 Lambert was sent by Fairfax as major-general
to take charge of the forces in the northern counties.
His wise and just managing of affairs in those parts is commended
by Whitelocke. He suppressed a mutiny among his troops,
kept strict discipline and hunted down the moss-troopers who
infested the moorland country.</p>

<p>When the Scottish army under the marquis of Hamilton
invaded England in the summer of 1648, Lambert was engaged
in suppressing the Royalist rising in his district. The arrival
of the Scots obliged him to retreat; but Lambert displayed the
greatest energy and did not cease to harass the invaders till
Cromwell came up from Wales and with him destroyed the
Scottish army in the three days&rsquo; fighting from Preston to Warrington.
After the battle Lambert&rsquo;s cavalry headed the chase,
pursuing the defeated army <i>à outrance</i>, and finally surrounded
it at Uttoxeter, where Hamilton surrendered to Lambert on the
25th of August. He then led the advance of Cromwell&rsquo;s army
into Scotland, where he was left in charge on Cromwell&rsquo;s return.
From December 1648 to March 1649 he was engaged in the siege
of Pontefract Castle; Lambert was thus absent from London at
the time of Pride&rsquo;s Purge and the trial and execution of the king.</p>

<p>When Cromwell was appointed to the command of the war
in Scotland (July 1650), Lambert went with him as major-general
and second in command. He was wounded at Musselburgh,
but returned to the front in time to take a conspicuous
share in the victory of Dunbar. He himself defeated the
&ldquo;Protesters&rdquo; or &ldquo;Western Whigs&rdquo; at Hamilton, on the 1st
of December 1650. In July 1651 he was sent into Fife to get
in the rear and flank of the Scottish army near Falkirk, and
force them to decisive action by cutting off their supplies. This
mission, in the course of which Lambert won an important
victory at Inverkeithing, was executed with entire success,
whereupon Charles II., as Lambert had foreseen, made for
England. For the events of the Worcester campaign, which
quickly followed, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Great Rebellion</a></span>. Lambert&rsquo;s part in
the general plan was carried out most brilliantly, and in the
crowning victory of Worcester he commanded the right wing of
the English army, and had his horse shot under him. Parliament
now conferred on him a grant of lands in Scotland worth £1000
per annum.</p>

<p>In October 1651 Lambert was made a commissioner to settle
the affairs of Scotland, and on the death of Ireton he was appointed
lord deputy of Ireland (January 1652). He accepted the
office with pleasure, and made magnificent preparations;
parliament, however, soon afterwards reconstituted the Irish
administration and Lambert refused to accept office on the new
terms. Henceforward he began to oppose the Rump. In the
council of officers he headed the party desiring representative
government, as opposed to Harrison who favoured a selected
oligarchy of &ldquo;God-fearing&rdquo; men, but both hated what remained
of the Long parliament, and joined in urging Cromwell to dissolve
it by force. At the same time Lambert was consulted by the
parliamentary leaders as to the possibility of dismissing Cromwell
from his command, and on the 15th of March 1653 Cromwell
refused to see him, speaking of him contemptuously as &ldquo;bottomless
Lambert.&rdquo; On the 20th of April, however, Lambert accompanied
Cromwell when he dismissed the council of state, on the
same day as the forcible expulsion of the parliament. Lambert
now favoured the formation of a small executive council, to be
followed by an elective parliament whose powers should be
limited by a written instrument of government. Being at this
time the ruling spirit in the council of state, and the idol of the
army, there were some who looked on him as a possible rival
of Cromwell for the chief executive power, while the royalists
for a short time had hopes of his support. He was invited,
with Cromwell, Harrison and Desborough, to sit in the nominated
parliament of 1653; and when the unpopularity of that assembly
increased, Cromwell drew nearer to Lambert. In November
1653 Lambert presided over a meeting of officers, when the
question of constitutional settlement was discussed, and a proposal
made for the forcible expulsion of the nominated parliament.
On the 1st of December he urged Cromwell to assume the title
of king, which the latter refused. On the 12th the parliament
resigned its powers into Cromwell&rsquo;s hands, and on the 13th
Lambert obtained the consent of the officers to the Instrument
of Government (<i>q.v.</i>), in the framing of which he had taken a
leading part. He was one of the seven officers nominated to
seats in the council created by the Instrument. In the foreign
policy of the protectorate he was the most clamorous of those
who called for alliance with Spain and war with France in 1653,
and he firmly withstood Cromwell&rsquo;s design for an expedition
to the West Indies.</p>

<p>In the debates in parliament on the Instrument of Government
in 1654 Lambert proposed that the office of protector
should be made hereditary, but was defeated by a majority
which included members of Cromwell&rsquo;s family. In the parliament
of this year, and again in 1656, Lord Lambert, as he was
now styled, sat as member for the West Riding. He was one of
the major-generals appointed in August 1655 to command the
militia in the ten districts into which it was proposed to divide
England, and who were to be responsible for the maintenance
of order and the administration of the law in their several districts.
Lambert took a prominent part in the committee of council
which drew up instructions to the major-generals, and he was
probably the originator, and certainly the organizer, of the
system of police which these officers were to control. Gardiner
conjectures that it was through divergence of opinion between
the protector and Lambert in connexion with these &ldquo;instructions&rdquo;
that the estrangement between the two men began.
At all events, although Lambert had himself at an earlier date
requested Cromwell to take the royal dignity, when the proposal
to declare Oliver king was started in parliament (February
1657) he at once declared strongly against it. A hundred officers
headed by Fleetwood and Lambert waited on the protector, and
begged him to put a stop to the proceedings. Lambert was not
convinced by Cromwell&rsquo;s arguments, and their complete estrangement,
personal as well as political, followed. On his refusal
to take the oath of allegiance to the protector, Lambert was
deprived of his commissions, receiving, however, a pension of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>
£2000 a year. He retired to his garden at Wimbledon, and
appeared no more in public during Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s lifetime;
but shortly before his death Cromwell sought a reconciliation,
and Lambert and his wife visited him at Whitehall.</p>

<p>When Richard Cromwell was proclaimed protector his chief
difficulty lay with the army, over which he exercised no effective
control. Lambert, though holding no military commission, was
the most popular of the old Cromwellian generals with the
rank and file of the army, and it was very generally believed
that he would instal himself in Oliver&rsquo;s seat of power. Richard&rsquo;s
adherents tried to conciliate him, and the royalist leaders made
overtures to him, even proposing that Charles II. should marry
Lambert&rsquo;s daughter. Lambert at first gave a lukewarm support
to Richard Cromwell, and took no part in the intrigues of the
officers at Fleetwood&rsquo;s residence, Wallingford House. He was
a member of the parliament which met in January 1659,
and when it was dissolved in April under compulsion of Fleetwood
and Desborough, he was restored to his commands. He headed
the deputation to Lenthall in May inviting the return of the
Rump, which led to the tame retirement of Richard Cromwell
into obscurity; and he was appointed a member of the committee
of safety and of the council of state. When the parliament,
desirous of controlling the power of the army, withheld
from Fleetwood the right of nominating officers, Lambert was
named one of a council of seven charged with this duty. The
parliament&rsquo;s evident distrust of the soldiers caused much discontent
in the army; while the entire absence of real authority
encouraged the royalists to make overt attempts to restore
Charles II., the most serious of which, under Sir George Booth
and the earl of Derby, was crushed by Lambert near Chester
on the 19th of August. He promoted a petition from his army
that Fleetwood might be made lord-general and himself major-general.
The republican party in the House took offence.
The Commons (October 12th, 1659) cashiered Lambert and other
officers, and retained Fleetwood as chief of a military council
under the authority of the speaker. On the next day Lambert
caused the doors of the House to be shut and the members
kept out. On the 26th a &ldquo;committee of safety&rdquo; was appointed,
of which he was a member. He was also appointed major-general
of all the forces in England and Scotland, Fleetwood
being general. Lambert was now sent with a large force to
meet Monk, who was in command of the English forces in
Scotland, and either negotiate with him or force him to terms.
Monk, however, set his army in motion southward. Lambert&rsquo;s
army began to melt away, and he was kept in suspense by Monk
till his whole army fell from him and he returned to London
almost alone. Monk marched to London unopposed. The
&ldquo;excluded&rdquo; Presbyterian members were recalled. Lambert
was sent to the Tower (March 3rd, 1660), from which he escaped
a month later. He tried to rekindle the civil war in favour of
the Commonwealth, but was speedily recaptured and sent back
to the Tower (April 24th). On the Restoration he was exempted
from danger of life by an address of both Houses to the king,
but the next parliament (1662) charged him with high treason.
Thenceforward for the rest of his life Lambert remained in
custody in Guernsey. He died in 1694.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lambert would have left a better name in history if he had been a
cavalier. His genial, ardent and excitable nature, easily raised and
easily depressed, was more akin to the royalist than to the puritan
spirit. Vain and sometimes overbearing, as well as ambitious, he
believed that Cromwell could not stand without him; and when
Cromwell was dead, he imagined himself entitled and fitted to succeed
him. Yet his ambition was less selfish than that of Monk. Lambert
is accused of no ill faith, no want of generosity, no cold and calculating
policy. As a soldier he was far more than a fighting general
and possessed many of the qualities of a great general. He was,
moreover, an able writer and speaker, and an accomplished negotiator
and took pleasure in quiet and domestic pursuits. He learnt his love
of gardening from Lord Fairfax, who was also his master in the art of
war. He painted flowers, besides cultivating them, and incurred the
blame of Mrs Hutchinson by &ldquo;dressing his flowers in his garden and
working at the needle with his wife and his maids.&rdquo; He made no
special profession of religion; but no imputation is cast upon his
moral character by his detractors. It has been said that he became
a Roman Catholic before his death.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMBERT OF HERSFELD<a name="ar200" id="ar200"></a></span> (d. <i>c.</i> 1088), German chronicler,
was probably a Thuringian by birth and became a monk in the
Benedictine abbey of Hersfeld in 1058. As he was ordained
priest at Aschaffenburg he is sometimes called Lambert of
Aschaffenburg, or Schafnaburg. He made a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land, and visited various monasteries of his order; but
he is famous as the author of some <i>Annales</i>. From the creation
of the world until about 1040 these <i>Annales</i> are a jejune copy
of other annals, but from 1040 to their conclusion in 1077 they
are interesting for the history of Germany and the papacy.
The important events during the earlier part of the reign of
the emperor Henry IV., including the visit to Canossa and the
battle of Hohenburg, are vividly described. Their tone is
hostile to Henry IV. and friendly to the papacy; their Latin
style is excellent. The <i>Annales</i> were first published in 1525 and
are printed in the <i>Monumenta Germaniae historica</i>, Bände
iii. and v. (Hanover and Berlin, 1826 fol.). Formerly Lambert&rsquo;s
reputation for accuracy and impartiality was very high, but
both qualities have been somewhat discredited.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lambert is also regarded as the author of the <i>Historia Hersfeldensis</i>,
the extant fragments of which are published in Band v. of the
<i>Monumenta</i> of a <i>Vita Lulli</i>, Lullus, archbishop of Mainz, being the
founder of the abbey of Hersfeld; and of a <i>Carmen de bello Saxonico</i>.
His <i>Opera</i> have been edited with an introduction by O. Holder-Egger
(Hanover, 1894).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMBESSA<a name="ar201" id="ar201"></a></span>, the ancient Lambaesa, a village of Algeria, in
the arrondissement of Batna and department of Constantine,
7 m. S.E. of Batna and 17 W. of Timgad. The modern village,
the centre of an agricultural colony founded in 1848, is noteworthy
for its great convict establishment (built about 1850). The
remains of the Roman town, and more especially of the Roman
camp, in spite of wanton vandalism, are among the most interesting
ruins in northern Africa. They are now preserved by the
<i>Service des Monuments historiques</i> and excavations have resulted
in many interesting discoveries. The ruins are situated on the
lower terraces of the Jebel Aures, and consist of triumphal
arches (one to Septimius Severus, another to Commodus),
temples, aqueducts, vestiges of an amphitheatre, baths and
an immense quantity of masonry belonging to private houses.
To the north and east lie extensive cemeteries with the stones
standing in their original alignments; to the west is a similar
area, from which, however, the stones have been largely removed
for building the modern village. Of the temple of Aesculapius
only one column is standing, though in the middle of the 19th
century its façade was entire. The capitol or temple dedicated
to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, which has been cleared of débris,
has a portico with eight columns. On level ground about two-thirds
of a mile from the centre of the ancient town stands the
camp, its site now partly occupied by the penitentiary and its
gardens. It measures 1640 ft. N. to S. by 1476 ft. E. to W., and
in the middle rise the ruins of a building commonly called, but
incorrectly, the praetorium. This noble building, which dates
from <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 268, is 92 ft. long by 66 ft. broad and 49 ft. high;
its southern façade has a splendid peristyle half the height
of the wall, consisting of a front row of massive Ionic columns
and an engaged row of Corinthian pilasters. Behind this
building (which was roofed), is a large court giving access to
other buildings, one being the arsenal. In it have been found
many thousands of projectiles. To the S.E. are the remains of
the baths. The ruins of both city and camp have yielded many
inscriptions (Renier edited 1500, and there are 4185 in the <i>Corpus
Inscr. Lat.</i> vol. viii.); and, though a very large proportion are
epitaphs of the barest kind, the more important pieces supply
an outline of the history of the place. Over 2500 inscriptions
relating to the camp have been deciphered. In a museum in
the village are objects of antiquity discovered in the vicinity.
Besides inscriptions, statues, &amp;c., are some fine mosaics found
in 1905 near the arch of Septimius Severus. The statues include
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
those of Aesculapius and Hygieia, taken from the temple of
Aesculapius.</p>

<p>Lambaesa was a military foundation. The camp of the third
legion (Legio III. Augusta), to which it owes its origin, appears to
have been established between <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 123 and 129, in the time of
Hadrian, whose address to his soldiers was found inscribed on a
pillar in a second camp to the west of the great camp still extant.
By 166 mention is made of the decurions of a vicus, 10 curiae of which
are known by name; and the vicus became a municipium probably
at the time when it was made the capital of the newly founded
province of Numidia. The legion was removed by Gordianus, but
restored by Valerianus and Gallienus; and its final departure did
not take place till after 392. The town soon afterwards declined.
It never became the seat of a bishop, and no Christian inscriptions
have been found among the ruins.</p>

<p>About 2 m. S. of Lambessa are the ruins of Markuna, the ancient
Verecunda, including two triumphal arches.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMBETH,<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> a southern metropolitan borough of London,
England, bounded N.W. by the river Thames, N.E. by Southwark,
E. by Camberwell and W. by Wandsworth and Battersea,
and extending S. to the boundary of the county of London.
Pop. (1901) 301,895. The name is commonly confined to the
northern part of the borough, bordering the river; but the
principal districts included are Kennington and Vauxhall (north
central), Brixton (central) and part of Norwood (south). Four
road-bridges cross the Thames within the limits of the borough,
namely Waterloo, Westminster, Lambeth and Vauxhall, of
which the first, a fine stone structure, dates from 1817, and is
the oldest Thames bridge standing within the county of London.
The main thoroughfare runs S. from Westminster Bridge Road
as Kennington Road, continuing as Brixton Road and Brixton
Hill, Clapham Road branching S.W. from it at Kennington.
Several thoroughfares also converge upon Vauxhall Bridge, and
from a point near this down to Westminster Bridge the river
is bordered by the fine Albert Embankment.</p>

<p>Early records present the name <i>Lamb-hythe</i> in various forms.
The suffix is common along the river in the meaning of a haven,
but the prefix is less clear; a Saxon word signifying mud is
suggested. Brixton and Kennington are mentioned in Domesday;
and in Vauxhall is concealed the name of Falkes de Breauté,
an unscrupulous adventurer of the time of John and Henry III.
exiled in 1225. The manor of North Lambeth was given to the
bishopric of Rochester in the time of Edward the Confessor,
and the bishops had a house here till the 16th century. They did
not, however, retain the manor beyond the close of the 12th
century, when it was acquired by the see of Canterbury. The
palace of the archbishops is still here, and forms, with the parish
church, a picturesque group of buildings, lying close to the river
opposite the majestic Houses of Parliament, and to some extent
joining with them to make of this reach of the Thames one of
the finest prospects in London. The oldest part of the palace
remaining is the Early English chapel. The so-called Lollard&rsquo;s
Tower, which retains evidence of its use as a prison, dates
<i>c.</i> 1440. There is a fine Tudor gatehouse of brick, and the hall
is dated 1663. The portion now inhabited by the archbishops
was erected in 1834 and fronts a spacious quadrangle. Among
the portraits of the archbishops here are examples by Holbein,
Van Dyck, Hogarth and Reynolds. There is a valuable library.
The church of St Mary was rebuilt <i>c.</i> 1850, though the ancient
monuments preserved give it an appearance of antiquity. Here
are tombs of some of the archbishops, including Bancroft (d.
1610), and of the two Tradescants, collectors, and a memorial
to Elias Ashmole, whose name is preserved in the Ashmolean
Museum at Oxford University, to which he presented the collections
of his friend the younger Tradescant (d. 1662). In the
present Westminster Bridge Road was a circus, well known in
the later 18th and early 19th centuries as Astley&rsquo;s, and near
Vauxhall Bridge were the celebrated Vauxhall Gardens.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The principal modern pleasure grounds are Kennington Park (20
acres), and Brockwell Park (127 acres) south of Brixton, and near the
southern end of Kennington Road is Kennington Oval, the ground
of the Surrey County Cricket Club, the scene of its home matches and
of other important fixtures. Among institutions the principal is
St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital, the extensive buildings of which front the
Albert Embankment. The original foundation dated from 1213, was
situated in Southwark, and was connected with the priory of
Bermondsey. The existing buildings, subsequently enlarged, were
opened in 1871, are divided into a series of blocks, and include a
medical school. Other hospitals are the Royal, for children and
women, Waterloo Road, the Lying-in Hospital, York Road, and the
South-western fever hospital in Stockwell. There are technical
institutes in Brixton and Norwood; and on Brixton Hill is Brixton
Prison. In the northern part of the borough are numerous factories,
including the great Doulton pottery works. The parliamentary
borough of Lambeth has four divisions, North, Kennington, Brixton
and Norwood, each returning one member. The borough council
consists of a mayor, 10 aldermen and 60 councillors. Area, 4080.4
acres.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMBETH CONFERENCES,<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> the name given to the periodical
assemblies of bishops of the Anglican Communion (Pan-Anglican
synods), which since 1867 have met at Lambeth Palace, the
London residence of the archbishop of Canterbury. The idea
of these meetings was first suggested in a letter to the archbishop
of Canterbury by Bishop Hopkins of Vermont in 1851, but the
immediate impulse came from the colonial Church in Canada.
In 1865 the synod of that province, in an urgent letter to the
archbishop of Canterbury (Dr Longley), represented the unsettlement
of members of the Canadian Church caused by recent legal
decisions of the Privy Council, and their alarm lest the revived
action of Convocation &ldquo;should leave us governed by canons
different from those in force in England and Ireland, and thus
cause us to drift into the status of an independent branch of
the Catholic Church.&rdquo; They therefore requested him to call
a &ldquo;national synod of the bishops of the Anglican Church at
home and abroad,&rdquo; to meet under his leadership. After consulting
both houses of the Convocation of Canterbury, Archbishop
Longley assented, and convened all the bishops of the Anglican
Communion (then 144 in number) to meet at Lambeth in 1867.
Many Anglican bishops (amongst them the archbishop of York
and most of his suffragans) felt so doubtful as to the wisdom of
such an assembly that they refused to attend it, and Dean
Stanley declined to allow Westminster Abbey to be used for
the closing service, giving as his reasons the partial character
of the assembly, uncertainty as to the effect of its measures
and &ldquo;the presence of prelates not belonging to our Church.&rdquo;
Archbishop Longley said in his opening address, however, that
they had no desire to assume &ldquo;the functions of a general synod
of all the churches in full communion with the Church of England,&rdquo;
but merely to &ldquo;discuss matters of practical interest, and pronounce
what we deem expedient in resolutions which may serve
as safe guides to future action.&rdquo; Experience has shown how
valuable and wise this course was. The resolutions of the
Lambeth Conferences have never been regarded as synodical
decrees, but their weight has increased with each conference.
Apprehensions such as those which possessed the mind of Dean
Stanley have long passed away.</p>

<p>Seventy-six bishops accepted the primate&rsquo;s invitation to the
first conference, which met at Lambeth on the 24th of September
1867, and sat for four days, the sessions being in private. The
archbishop opened the conference with an address: deliberation
followed; committees were appointed to report on special
questions; resolutions were adopted, and an encyclical letter
was addressed to the faithful of the Anglican Communion.
Each of the subsequent conferences has been first received in
Canterbury cathedral and addressed by the archbishop from
the chair of St Augustine. It has then met at Lambeth, and
after sitting for five days for deliberation upon the fixed subjects
and appointment of committees, has adjourned, to meet again
at the end of a fortnight and sit for five days more, to receive
reports, adopt resolutions and to put forth the encyclical
letter.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>I. <i>First Conference</i> (September 24-28, 1867), convened and presided
over by Archbishop Longley. The proposed order of subjects
was entirely altered in view of the Colenso case, for which urgency
was claimed; and most of the time was spent in discussing it. Of
the thirteen resolutions adopted by the conference, two have direct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
reference to this case; the rest have to do with the creation of new
sees and missionary jurisdictions, commendatory letters, and a
&ldquo;voluntary spiritual tribunal&rdquo; in cases of doctrine and the due
subordination of synods. The reports of the committees were not
ready, and were carried forward to the conference of 1878.</p>

<p>II. <i>Second Conference</i> (July 2-27, 1878), convened and presided
over by Archbishop Tait. On this occasion no hesitation appears
to have been felt; 100 bishops were present, and the opening
sermon was preached by the archbishop of York. The reports of the
five special committees (based in part upon those of the committee
of 1867) were embodied in the encyclical letter, viz. on the best mode
of maintaining union, voluntary boards of arbitration, missionary
bishops and missionaries, continental chaplains and the report of a
committee on difficulties submitted to the conference.</p>

<p>III. <i>Third Conference</i> (July 3-27, 1888), convened and presided
over by Archbishop Benson; 145 bishops present; the chief subject
of consideration being the position of communities which do not
possess the historic episcopate. In addition to the encyclical letter,
nineteen resolutions were put forth, and the reports of twelve special
committees are appended upon which they are based, the subjects
being intemperance, purity, divorce, polygamy, observance of
Sunday, socialism, care of emigrants, mutual relations of dioceses of
the Anglican Communion, home reunion, Scandinavian Church, Old
Catholics, &amp;c., Eastern Churches, standards of doctrine and worship.
Perhaps the most important of these is the famous &ldquo;Lambeth
Quadrilateral,&rdquo; which laid down a fourfold basis for home reunion&mdash;the
Holy Scriptures, the Apostles&rsquo; and Nicene creeds, the two
sacraments ordained by Christ himself and the historic episcopate.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Fourth Conference</i> (July 5-31, 1897), convened by Archbishop
Benson, presided over by Archbishop Temple; 194 bishops present.
One of the chief subjects for consideration was the creation of a
&ldquo;tribunal of reference&rdquo;; but the resolutions on this subject were
withdrawn, owing, it is said, to the opposition of the American
bishops, and a more general resolution in favour of a &ldquo;consultative
body&rdquo; was substituted. The encyclical letter is accompanied by
sixty-three resolutions (which include careful provision for provincial
organization and the extension of the title &ldquo;archbishop&rdquo; to all
metropolitans, a &ldquo;thankful recognition of the revival of brotherhoods
and sisterhoods, and of the office of deaconess,&rdquo; and a desire to promote
friendly relations with the Eastern Churches and the various
Old Catholic bodies), and the reports of the eleven committees are
subjoined.</p>

<p>V. <i>Fifth Conference</i> (July 6-August 5, 1908), convened by Archbishop
Randall Davidson, who presided; 241 bishops were present.
The chief subjects of discussion were: the relations of faith and
modern thought, the supply and training of the clergy, education,
foreign missions, revision and &ldquo;enrichment&rdquo; of the Prayer-Book,
the relation of the Church to &ldquo;ministries of healing&rdquo; (Christian
Science, &amp;c.), the questions of marriage and divorce, organization of
the Anglican Church, reunion with other Churches. The results of
the deliberations were embodied in seventy-eight resolutions, which
were appended to the encyclical issued, in the name of the conference,
by the Archbishop of Canterbury on the 8th of August.</p>

<p>The fifth Lambeth conference, following as it did close on the great
Pan-Anglican congress, is remarkable mainly as a proof of the growth
of the influence and many-sided activity of the Anglican Church, and
as a conspicuous manifestation of her characteristic principles. Of
the seventy-eight resolutions none is in any sense epoch-making,
and their spirit is that of the traditional Anglican <i>via media</i>. In
general they are characterized by a firm adherence to the fundamental
articles of Catholic orthodoxy, tempered by a tolerant
attitude towards those not of &ldquo;the household of the faith.&rdquo; The
report of the committee on faith and modern thought is &ldquo;a faithful
attempt to show how the claim of our Lord Jesus Christ, which the
Church is set to present to each generation, may, under the characteristic
conditions of our time, best command allegiance.&rdquo; On the
question of education (Res. 11-19) the conference reaffirmed strongly
the necessity for definite Christian teaching in schools, &ldquo;secular
systems&rdquo; being condemned as &ldquo;educationally as well as morally
unsound, since they fail to co-ordinate the training of the whole
nature of the child&rdquo; (Res. 11). The resolutions on questions affecting
foreign missions (20-26) deal with <i>e.g.</i> the overlapping of episcopal
jurisdictions (22) and the establishment of Churches on lines of race
or colour, which is condemned (20). The resolutions on questions of
marriage and divorce (37-43) reaffirm the traditional attitude of the
Church; it is, however, interesting to note that the resolution (40)
deprecating the remarriage in church of the innocent party to a
divorce was carried only by eighty-seven votes to eighty-four. In
resolutions 44 to 53 the conference deals with the duty of the Church
towards modern democratic ideals and social problems; affirms the
responsibility of investors for the character and conditions of the
concerns in which their money is placed (49); &ldquo;while frankly acknowledging
the moral gains sometimes won by war&rdquo; strongly
supports the extension of international arbitration (52); and
emphasizes the duty of a stricter observance of Sunday (53). On the
question of reunion, the ideal of corporate unity was reaffirmed (58).
It was decided to send a deputation of bishops with a letter of
greeting to the national council of the Russian Church about to be
assembled (60) and certain conditions were laid down for inter-communion
with certain of the Churches of the Orthodox Eastern
Communion (62) and the &ldquo;ancient separated Churches of the East&rdquo;
(63-65). Resolution 67 warned Anglicans from contracting marriages,
under actual conditions, with Roman Catholics. By resolution 68
the conference stated its desire to &ldquo;maintain and strengthen the
friendly relations&rdquo; between the Churches of the Anglican Communion
and &ldquo;the ancient Church of Holland&rdquo; (Jansenist, see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Utrecht</a></span>) and the old Catholic Churches; and resolutions 70-73
made elaborate provisions for a projected corporate union between
the Anglican Church and the <i>Unitas Fratrum</i> (Moravian Brethren).
As to &ldquo;home reunion,&rdquo; however, it was made perfectly clear that
this would only be possible &ldquo;on lines suggested by such precedents
as those of 1610,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> by the Presbyterian Churches accepting the
episcopal model. So far as the organization of the Anglican Church
is concerned, the most important outcome of the conference was
the reconstruction of the Central Consultative Body on representative
lines (54-56); this body to consist of the archbishop of Canterbury
and seventeen bishops appointed by the various Churches of the
Anglican Communion throughout the world. A notable feature of
the conference was the presence of the Swedish bishop of Kalmar,
who presented a letter from the archbishop of Upsala, as a tentative
advance towards closer relations between the Anglican Church and
the Evangelical Church of Sweden.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMBINUS, DIONYSIUS,<a name="ar204" id="ar204"></a></span> the Latinized name of <span class="sc">Denis
Lambin</span> (1520-1572), French classical scholar, born at Montreuil-sur-mer
in Picardy. Having devoted several years to classical
studies during a residence in Italy, he was invited to Paris in
1650 to fill the professorship of Latin in the Collège de France,
which he soon afterwards exchanged for that of Greek. His
lectures were frequently interrupted by his ill-health and the
religious disturbances of the time. His death (September 1572)
is said to have been caused by his apprehension that he might
share the fate of his friend Peter Ramus (Pierre de la Ramée),
who had been killed in the massacre of St Bartholomew.
Lambinus was one of the greatest scholars of his age, and his
editions of classical authors are still useful. In textual criticism
he was a conservative, but by no means a slavish one; indeed,
his opponents accused him of rashness in emendation. His chief
defect is that he refers vaguely to his MSS. without specifying
the source of his readings, so that their relative importance
cannot be estimated. But his commentaries, with their wealth
of illustration and parallel passages, are a mine of information.
In the opinion of the best scholars, he preserved the happy
mean in his annotations, although his own countrymen have
coined the word <i>lambiner</i> to express trifling and diffuseness.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His chief editions are: Horace (1561); Lucretius (1564), on which
see H. A. J. Munro&rsquo;s preface to his edition; Cicero (1566); Cornelius

<p><span class="bold">LAMECH<a name="ar206" id="ar206"></a></span> <span title="Lemech">&#1500;&#1502;&#1498;</span>, the biblical patriarch, appears in each of
the antediluvian genealogies, Gen. iv. 16-24 J., and Gen. v. P.
In the former he is a descendant of Cain, and through his sons
the author of primitive civilization; in the latter he is the father
of Noah. But it is now generally held that these two genealogies
are variant adaptations of the Babylonian list of primitive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
kings (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Enoch</a></span>). It is doubtful whether Lamech is to be
identified with the name of any one of these kings; he may
have been introduced into the genealogy from another tradition.</p>

<p>In the older narrative in Gen. iv. Lamech&rsquo;s family are the
originators of various advances in civilization; he himself
is the first to marry more than one wife, &lsquo;Adah (&ldquo;ornament,&rdquo;
perhaps specially &ldquo;dawn&rdquo;) and Zillah (&ldquo;shadow&rdquo;). He has
three sons Jabal, Jubal, and Tubal, the last-named qualified by
the addition of Cain (= &ldquo;smith&rdquo;<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a>). The assonance of these
names is probably intentional, cf. the brothers Hasan and Hosein
of early Mahommedan history. Jabal institutes the life of
nomadic shepherds, Jubal is the inventor of music, Tubal-Cain
the first smith. Jabal and Jubal may be forms of a root used in
Hebrew and Phoenician for ram and ram&rsquo;s horn (<i>i.e.</i> trumpet),
and underlying our &ldquo;jubilee.&rdquo; Tubal may be the eponymous
ancestor of the people of that name mentioned in Ezekiel in
connexion with &ldquo;vessels of bronze.&rdquo;<a name="fa2l" id="fa2l" href="#ft2l"><span class="sp">2</span></a> All three names are
sometimes derived from <span title="yuval">&#1497;&#1489;&#1500;</span> in the sense of offspring, so that
they would be three different words for &ldquo;son,&rdquo; and there are
numerous other theories as to their etymology. Lamech has
also a daughter Naamah (&ldquo;gracious,&rdquo; &ldquo;pleasant,&rdquo; &ldquo;comely&rdquo;;
cf. No&rsquo;mân, a name of the deity Adonis). This narrative clearly
intends to account for the origin of these various arts as they
existed in the narrator&rsquo;s time; it is not likely that he thought
of these discoveries as separated from his own age by a universal
flood; nor does the tone of the narrative suggest that the
primitive tradition thought of these pioneers of civilization as
members of an accursed family. Probably the passage was
originally independent of the document which told of Cain and
Abel and of the Flood; Jabal may be a variant of Abel. An
ancient poem is connected with this genealogy:</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;</p>
<p class="i05">Ye wives of Lamech, give ear unto my speech.</p>
<p class="i05">I slay a man for a wound,</p>
<p class="i05">A young man for a stroke;</p>
<p class="i05">For Cain&rsquo;s vengeance is sevenfold,</p>
<p class="i05">But Lamech&rsquo;s seventy-fold and seven.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">In view of the connexion, the poem is interpreted as expressing
Lamech&rsquo;s exultation at the advantage he expects to derive
from Tubal-Cain&rsquo;s new inventions; the worker in bronze will
forge for him new and formidable weapons, so that he will be
able to take signal vengeance for the least injury. But the poem
probably had originally nothing to do with the genealogy. It
may have been a piece of folk-song celebrating the prowess
of the tribe of Lamech; or it may have had some relation to
a story of Cain and Abel in which Cain was a hero and not a
villain.</p>

<p>The genealogy in Gen. v. belongs to the Priestly Code, <i>c.</i>
450 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and may be due to a revision of ancient tradition in
the light of Babylonian archaeology. It is noteworthy that
according to the numbers in the Samaritan MSS. Lamech dies
in the year of the Flood.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The origin of the name Lamech and its original meaning are
doubtful. It was probably the name of a tribe or deity, or both.
According to C. J. Ball,<a name="fa3l" id="fa3l" href="#ft3l"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Lamech is an adaptation of the Babylonian
<i>Lamga</i>, a title of Sin the moon god, and synonymous with <i>Ubara</i>
in the name Ubara-Tutu, the Otiartes of Berossus, who is the ninth
of the ten primitive Babylonian kings, and the father of the hero of
the Babylonian flood story, just as Lamech is the ninth patriarch,
and the father of Noah. Spurrell<a name="fa4l" id="fa4l" href="#ft4l"><span class="sp">4</span></a> states that Lamech cannot be
explained from the Hebrew, but may possibly be connected with the
Arabic <i>yalmakun</i>, &ldquo;a strong young man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside of Genesis, Lamech is only mentioned in the Bible in 1
Chron. i. 3, Luke iii. 36. Later Jewish tradition expanded and interpreted
the story in its usual fashion.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMEGO<a name="ar207" id="ar207"></a></span>, a city of northern Portugal, in the district of Vizeu
and formerly included in the province of Beira; 6 m. by road
S. of the river Douro and 42 m. E. of Oporto. Pop. (1900)
9471. The nearest railway station is Peso da Regoa, on the
opposite side of the Douro and on the Barca d&rsquo;Alva-Oporto
railway. Lamego is an ancient and picturesque city, in the
midst of a beautiful mountain region. Its principal buildings
are the 14th-century Gothic cathedral, Moorish citadel, Roman
baths and a church which occupies the site of a mosque, and,
though intrinsically commonplace, is celebrated in Portugal
as the seat of the legendary cortes of 1143 or 1144 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Portugal</a></span>,
<i>History</i>). The principal industries are viticulture and the
rearing of swine, which furnish the so-called &ldquo;Lisbon hams.&rdquo;
Lamego was a Moorish frontier fortress of some importance
in the 9th and 10th centuries. It was captured in 1057 by
Ferdinand I. of Castile and Leon.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMELLIBRANCHIA<a name="ar208" id="ar208"></a></span> (Lat. <i>lamella</i>, a small or thin plate,
and Gr. <span class="grk" title="branchia">&#946;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#967;&#953;&#945;</span>, gills), the fourth of the five classes of animals
constituting the phylum Mollusca (<i>q.v.</i>). The Lamellibranchia
are mainly characterized by the rudimentary condition of the
head, and the retention of the primitive bilateral symmetry,
the latter feature being accentuated by the lateral compression
of the body and the development of the shell as two bilaterally
symmetrical plates or valves covering each one side of the
animal. The foot is commonly a simple cylindrical or ploughshare-shaped
organ, used for boring in sand and mud, and more
rarely presents a crawling disk similar to that of Gastropoda;
in some forms it is aborted. The paired ctenidia are very greatly
developed right and left of the elongated body, and form the
most prominent organ of the group. Their function is chiefly
not respiratory but nutritive, since it is by the currents produced
by their ciliated surface that food-particles are brought to the
feebly-developed mouth and buccal cavity.</p>

<p>The Lamellibranchia present as a whole a somewhat uniform
structure. The chief points in which they vary are&mdash;(1) in the
structure of the ctenidia or branchial plates; (2) in the presence
of one or of two chief muscles, the fibres of which run across the
animal&rsquo;s body from one valve of the shell to the other (adductors);
(3) in the greater or less elaboration of the posterior portion of
the mantle-skirt so as to form a pair of tubes, by one of which
water is introduced into the sub-pallial chamber, whilst by the
other it is expelled; (4) in the perfect or deficient symmetry
of the two valves of the shell and the connected soft parts, as
compared with one another; (5) in the development of the foot
as a disk-like crawling organ (<i>Arca</i>, <i>Nucula</i>, <i>Pectunculus</i>,
<i>Trigonia</i>, <i>Lepton</i>, <i>Galeomma</i>), as a simple plough-like or tongue-shaped
organ (<i>Unionidae</i>, &amp;c.), as a re-curved saltatory organ
(<i>Cardium</i>, &amp;c.), as a long burrowing cylinder (<i>Solenidae</i>, &amp;c.),
or its partial (Mytilacea) or even complete abortion (Ostraeacea).</p>

<p>The essential Molluscan organs are, with these exceptions,
uniformly well developed. The mantle-skirt is always long,
and hides the rest of the animal from view, its dependent margins
meeting in the middle line below the ventral surface when the
animal is retracted; it is, as it were, slit in the median line
before and behind so as to form two flaps, a right and a left;
on these the right and the left calcareous valves of the shell
are borne respectively, connected by an uncalcified part of the
shell called the ligament. In many embryo Lamellibranchs a
centro-dorsal primitive shell-gland or follicle has been detected.
The mouth lies in the median line anteriorly, the anus in the
median line posteriorly.</p>

<p>Both ctenidia, right and left, are invariably present, the axis
of each taking origin from the side of the body as in the schematic
archi-Mollusc (see fig. 15). A pair of renal tubes opening right
and left, rather far forward on the sides of the body, are always
present. Each opens by its internal extremity into the pericardium.
A pair of genital apertures, connected by genital
ducts with the paired gonads, are found right and left near the
nephridial pores, except in a few cases where the genital duct
joins that of the renal organ (<i>Spondylus</i>). The sexes are often,
but not always, distinct. No accessory glands or copulatory
organs are ever present in Lamellibranchs. The ctenidia often
act as brood-pouches.</p>

<p>A dorsal contractile heart, with symmetrical right and left
auricles receiving aerated blood from the ctenidia and mantle-skirt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
is present, being unequally developed only in those few
forms which are inequivalve. The typical pericardium is well
developed. It, as in other Mollusca, is not a blood-space but
develops from the coelom, and it communicates with the
exterior by the pair of renal tubes. As in Cephalopoda (and
possibly other Mollusca) water can be introduced through
the nephridia into this space. The alimentary canal keeps very
nearly to the median vertical plane whilst exhibiting a number
of flexures and loopings in this plane. A pair of large glandular
outgrowths, the so-called &ldquo;liver&rdquo; or great digestive gland,
exists as in other Molluscs. A pair of pedal otocysts, and a
pair of osphradia at the base of the gills, appear to be always
present. A typical nervous system is present (fig. 19), consisting
of a cerebro-pleural ganglion-pair, united by connectives to a
pedal ganglion-pair and a visceral ganglion-pair (parieto-splanchnic).</p>

<p>A pyloric caecum connected with the stomach is commonly
found, containing a tough flexible cylinder of transparent
cartilaginous appearance, called the &ldquo;crystalline style&rdquo; (<i>Mactra</i>).
In many Lamellibranchs a gland is found on the hinder surface
of the foot in the mid line, which secretes a substance which
sets into the form of threads&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;byssus&rdquo;&mdash;by
means of which the animal can fix itself. Sometimes this gland
is found in the young and not in the adult (<i>Anodonta</i>, <i>Unio</i>,
<i>Cyclas</i>). In some Lamellibranchs (<i>Pecten</i>, <i>Spondylus</i>, <i>Pholas</i>,
<i>Mactra</i>, <i>Tellina</i>, <i>Pectunculus</i>, <i>Galeomma</i>, &amp;c.), although cephalic
eyes are generally absent, special eyes are developed on the free
margin of the mantle-skirt, apparently by the modification of
tentacles commonly found there. There are no pores in the foot
or elsewhere in Lamellibranchia by which water can pass into
and out of the vascular system, as formerly asserted.</p>

<p>The Lamellibranchia live chiefly in the sea, some in fresh waters.
A very few have the power of swimming by opening and shutting
the valves of the shell (<i>Pecten</i>, <i>Lima</i>); most can crawl slowly
or burrow rapidly; others are, when adult, permanently fixed
to stones or rocks either by the shell or the byssus. In development
some Lamellibranchia pass through a free-swimming
trochosphere stage with pre-oral ciliated band; other fresh-water
forms which carry the young in brood-pouches formed
by the ctenidia have suppressed this larval phase.</p>

<p class="pt2">As an example of the organization of a Lamellibranch, we
shall review the structure of the common pond-mussel or swan
mussel (<i>Anodonta cygnea</i>), comparing it with other Lamellibranchia.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The swan-mussel has superficially a perfectly developed bilateral
symmetry. The left side of the animal is seen as when removed from
its shell in fig. 1 (1). The valves of the shell have been removed by
severing their adhesions to the muscular areae <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>u</i>. The
free edge of the left half of the mantle-skirt <i>b</i> is represented as a little
contracted in order to show the exactly similar free edge of the right
half of the mantle-skirt <i>c</i>. These edges are not attached to, although
they touch, one another; each flap (right or left) can be freely thrown
back in the way carried out in fig. 1 (3) for that of the left side. This
is not always the case with Lamellibranchs; there is in the group
a tendency for the corresponding edges of the mantle-skirt to fuse
together by concrescence, and so to form a more or less completely
closed bag, as in the Scaphopoda (<i>Dentalium</i>). In this way the
notches <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> of the hinder part of the mantle-skirt of <i>Anodonta</i> are in
the siphonate forms converted into two separate holes, the edges of
the mantle being elsewhere fused together along this hinder margin.
Further than this, the part of the mantle-skirt bounding the two
holes is frequently drawn out so as to form a pair of tubes which
project from the shell (figs. 8, 29). In such Lamellibranchs as the
oysters, scallops and many others which have the edges of the mantle-skirt
quite free, there are numerous tentacles upon those edges.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
In <i>Anodonta</i> these pallial tentacles are confined to a small area surrounding
the inferior siphonal notch (fig. 1 [3], <i>t</i>). When the edges
of the mantle ventral to the inhalant orifice are united, an anterior
aperture is left for the protrusion of the foot, and thus there are three
pallial apertures altogether, and species in this condition are called
&ldquo;Tripora.&rdquo; This is the usual condition in the Eulamellibranchia
and Septibranchia. When the pedal aperture is small and far
forward there may be a fourth aperture in the region of the fusion
behind the pedal aperture. This occurs in <i>Solen</i>, and such forms are
called &ldquo;Quadrifora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The centro-dorsal point <i>a</i> of the animal of <i>Anodonta</i> (fig. 1 [1]) is
called the umbonal area; the great anterior muscular surface <i>h</i> is that
of the anterior adductor muscle, the
posterior similar surface <i>i</i> is that of
the posterior adductor muscle; the long
line of attachment <i>u</i> is the simple
&ldquo;pallial muscle,&rdquo;&mdash;a thickened ridge
which is seen to run parallel to the
margin of the mantle-skirt in this
Lamellibranch. In siphonate forms the
pallial muscle is not simple, but is indented
posteriorly by a sinus formed by
the muscles which retract the siphons.</p>

<p>It is the approximate equality in the
size of the anterior and posterior adductor
muscles which led to the name
Isomya for the group to which <i>Anodonta</i>
belongs. The hinder adductor muscle
is always large in Lamellibranchs, but
the anterior adductor may be very
small (Heteromya), or absent altogether
(Monomya). The anterior adductor
muscle is in front of the mouth and
alimentary tract altogether, and must
be regarded as a special and peculiar
development of the median anterior part
of the mantle-flap. The posterior adductor
is ventral and anterior to the
anus. The former classification based on these differences in the
adductor muscles is now abandoned, having proved to be an unnatural
one. A single family may include isomyarian, anisomyarian
and monomyarian forms, and the latter in development pass through
stages in which they resemble the first two. In fact all Lamellibranchs
begin with a condition in which there is only one adductor, and that
not the posterior but the anterior. This is called the protomonomyarian
stage. Then the posterior adductor develops, and becomes
equal to the anterior, and finally in some cases the anterior becomes
smaller or disappears. The single adductor muscle of the Monomya
is separated by a difference of fibre into two portions, but neither of
these can be regarded as possibly representing the anterior adductor
of the other Lamellibranchs. One of these portions is more ligamentous
and
serves to keep the
two shells constantly
attached
to one another,
whilst the more
fleshy portion
serves to close the
shell rapidly when
it has been gaping.</p>

<p>In removing the
valves of the shell
from an <i>Anodonta</i>,
it is necessary
not only to cut
through the muscular
attachments
of the body-wall
to the shell but to
sever also a strong
elastic ligament,
or spring resembling
india-rubber, joining the two shells about the umbonal area.
The shell of <i>Anodonta</i> does not present these parts in the most
strongly marked condition, and accordingly our figures (figs. 2, 3, 4)
represent the valves of the sinupalliate genus <i>Cytherea</i>. The corresponding
parts are recognizable in <i>Anodonta</i>. Referring to the figures
(2, 3) for an explanation of terms applicable to the parts of the valve
and the markings on its inner surface&mdash;corresponding to the muscular
areas already noted on the surface of the animal&rsquo;s body&mdash;we must
specially note here the position of that denticulated thickening of the
dorsal margin of the valve which is called the hinge (fig. 4). By this
hinge one valve is closely fitted to the other. Below this hinge each
shell becomes concave, above it each shell rises a little to form the
umbo, and it is into this ridge-like upgrowth of each valve that the
elastic ligament or spring is fixed (fig. 4). As shown in the diagram
(fig. 5) representing a transverse section of the two valves of a
Lamellibranch, the two shells form a double lever, of which the
toothed-hinge is the fulcrum. The adductor muscles placed in the
concavity of the shells act upon the long arms of the lever at a
mechanical advantage; their contraction keeps the shells shut, and
stretches the ligament or spring <i>h</i>. On the other hand, the ligament
<i>h</i> acts upon the short arm formed by the umbonal ridge of the shells;
whenever the adductors relax, the elastic substance of the ligament
contracts, and the shells gape. It is on this account that the valves
of a dead Lamellibranch always gape; the elastic ligament is no
longer counteracted by the effort of the adductors. The state of
closure of the valves of the shell is not, therefore, one of rest; when
it is at rest&mdash;that is,
when there is no muscular
effort&mdash;the valves
of a Lamellibranch are
slightly gaping, and are
closed by the action of
the adductors when the
animal is disturbed. The
ligament is simple in
<i>Anodonta</i>; in many Lamellibranchs
it is separated
into two layers, an outer
and an inner (thicker and
denser). That the condition
of gaping of the
shell-valves is essential
to the life of the Lamellibranch
appears from the
fact that food to nourish
it, water to aerate its
blood, and spermatozoa
to fertilize its eggs, are
all introduced into this
gaping chamber by currents of water, set going by the highly-developed
ctenidia. The current of water enters into the sub-pallial
space at the spot marked <i>e</i> in fig. 1 (1), and, after passing as far forward
as the mouth <i>w</i> in fig. 1 (5), takes an outward course and
leaves the sub-pallial space by the upper notch <i>d</i>. These notches are
known in <i>Anodonta</i> as the afferent and efferent siphonal notches
respectively, and correspond to the long tube-like afferent inferior
and efferent superior &ldquo;siphons&rdquo; formed by the mantle in many
other Lamellibranchs (fig. 8).</p>

<p class="pt2">Whilst the valves of the shell are equal in <i>Anodonta</i> we find in
many Lamellibranchs (<i>Ostraea</i>, <i>Chama</i>, <i>Corbula</i>, &amp;c.) one valve
larger, and the other smaller and sometimes
flat, whilst the larger shell may be fixed to
rock or to stones (<i>Ostraea</i>, &amp;c.). A further
variation consists in the development of
additional shelly plates upon the dorsal line
between the two large valves (<i>Pholadidae</i>). In
<i>Pholas dactylus</i> we find a pair of umbonal
plates, a dors-umbonal plate and a dorsal
plate. It is to be remembered that the whole
of the cuticular hard product produced on
the dorsal surface and on the mantle-flaps
is to be regarded as the &ldquo;shell,&rdquo; of which a
median band-like area, the ligament, usually
remains uncalcified, so as to result in the production
of two valves united by the elastic
ligament. But the shelly substance does not
always in boring forms adhere to this form
after its first growth. In <i>Aspergillum</i> the
whole of the tubular mantle area secretes a
continuous shelly tube, although in the young
condition two valves were present. These
are seen (fig. 7) set in the firm substance of
the adult tubular shell, which has even replaced
the ligament, so that the tube is
complete. In <i>Teredo</i> a similar tube is formed
as the animal elongates (boring in wood),
the original shell-valves not adhering to it
but remaining movable and provided with
a special muscular apparatus in place of a
ligament. In the shell of Lamellibranchs
three distinct layers can be distinguished:
an external chitinous, non-calcified layer, the
periostracum; a middle layer composed of
calcareous prisms perpendicular to the surface,
the prismatic layer; and an internal layer
composed of laminae parallel to the surface,
the nacreous layer. The last is secreted by the
whole surface of the mantle except the border, and additions to its
thickness continue to be made through life. The periostracum is
produced by the extreme edge of the mantle border, the prismatic
layer by the part of the border within the edge. These two layers,
therefore, when once formed cannot increase in thickness; as the
mantle grows in extent its border passes beyond the formed parts
of the two outer layers, and the latter are covered internally by a
deposit of nacreous matter. Special deposits of the nacreous matter
around foreign bodies form pearls, the foreign nucleus being usually
of parasitic origin (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pearl</a></span>).</p>

<p>Let us now examine the organs which lie beneath the mantle-skirt
of <i>Anodonta</i>, and are bathed by the current of water which circulates
through it. This can be done by lifting up and throwing back the left
half of the mantle-skirt as is represented in fig. 1 (3). We thus expose
the plough-like foot (<i>f</i>), the two left labial tentacles, and the two left
gill-plates or left ctenidium. In fig. 1 (5), one of the labial tentacles <i>n</i>
is also thrown back to show the mouth <i>w</i>, and the two left gill-plates
are reflected to show the gill-plates of the right side (<i>rr</i>, <i>rq</i>) projecting
behind the foot, the inner or median plate of each side being
united by concrescence to its fellow of the opposite side along a
continuous line (<i>aa</i>). The left inner gill-plate is also snipped to show
the subjacent orifices of the left renal organ
<i>x</i>, and of the genital gland (testis or ovary) <i>y</i>.
The foot thus exposed in <i>Anodonta</i> is a simple
muscular tongue-like organ. It can be protruded
between the flaps of the mantle (fig. 1
[1] [2]) so as to issue from the shell, and by
its action the <i>Anodonta</i> can slowly crawl or
burrow in soft mud or sand. Other Lamellibranchs
may have a larger foot relatively than
has <i>Anodonta</i>. In <i>Arca</i> it has a sole-like
surface. In <i>Arca</i> too and many others it
carries a byssus-forming gland and a byssus-cementing
gland. In the cockles, in <i>Cardium</i>
and in <i>Trigonia</i>, it is capable of a sudden
stroke, which causes the animal to jump when
out of the water, in the latter genus to a
height of four feet. In <i>Mytilus</i> the foot is reduced to little more
than a tubercle carrying the apertures of these glands. In the
oyster it is absent altogether.</p>

<p>The labial tentacles or palps of <i>Anodonta</i> (<i>n</i>, <i>o</i> in fig. 1 [3], [5]) are
highly vascular flat processes richly supplied with nerves. The left
anterior tentacle (seen in the figure) is joined at its base in front of
the mouth (<i>w</i>) to the right anterior tentacle, and similarly the left (<i>o</i>)
and right posterior tentacles are joined behind the mouth. Those of
<i>Arca</i> (<i>i</i>, <i>k</i> in fig. 9) show this relation to the mouth (<i>a</i>). These organs
are characteristic of all Lamellibranchs; they do not vary except in
size, being sometimes drawn out to streamer-like dimensions. Their
appearance and position suggest that they are in some way related
morphologically to the gill-plates, the anterior labial tentacle being a
continuation of the outer gill-plate, and the posterior a continuation
of the inner gill-plate. There is no embryological evidence to support
this suggested connexion, and, as will appear immediately, the
history of the gill-plates in various forms of Lamellibranchs does not
directly favour it. The palps are really derived from part of the
velar area of the larva.</p>

<p>The gill-plates have a structure very different from that of the
labial tentacles, and one which in <i>Anodonta</i> is singularly complicated
as compared with the condition presented by these organs in some
other Lamellibranchs, and with what must have been their original
condition in the ancestors of the whole series of living Lamellibranchia.
The phenomenon of &ldquo;concrescence&rdquo; which we have
already had to note as showing itself so importantly in regard to the
free edges of the mantle-skirt and the formation of the siphons, is
what, above all things, has complicated the structure of the
Lamellibranch ctenidium. Our present knowledge of the interesting
series of modifications through which the Lamellibranch gill-plates
have developed to their most complicated form is due to
R. H. Peck, K. Mitsukuri and W. G. Ridewood. The Molluscan
ctenidium is typically a plume-like
structure, consisting of a
vascular axis, on each side of
which is set a row of numerous
lamelliform or filamentous processes.
These processes are
hollow, and receive the venous
blood from, and return it again
aerated into, the hollow axis,
in which an afferent and an
efferent blood-vessel may be
differentiated. In the genus
<i>Nucula</i> (fig. 10) we have an
example of a Lamellibranch
retaining this plume-like form
of gill. In the Arcacea (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Arca</i> and <i>Pectunculus</i>) the lateral
processes which are set on the
axis of the ctenidium are not
lamellae, but are slightly flattened,
very long tubes or hollow
filaments. These filaments are
so fine and are set so closely
together that they appear to
form a continuous membrane
until examined with a lens.
The microscope shows that the
neighbouring filaments are held
together by patches of cilia,
called &ldquo;ciliated junctions,&rdquo;
which interlock with one another
just as two brushes may be
made to do. In fig. 11, A a
portion of four filaments of a
ctenidium of the sea-mussel
(<i>Mytilus</i>) is represented, having
precisely the same structure as
those of <i>Arca</i>. The filaments
of the gill (ctenidium) of <i>Mytilus</i>
and <i>Arca</i> thus form two closely
set rows which depend from the
axis of the gill like two parallel
plates. Further, their structure
is profoundly modified by the
curious condition of the free
ends of the depending filaments.
These are actually reflected at a sharp angle&mdash;doubled on themselves
in fact&mdash;and thus form an additional row of filaments (see fig. 11 B).
Consequently, each primitive filament has a descending and an ascending
ramus, and instead of each row forming a simple plate, the plate
is double, consisting of a descending and an ascending lamella. As
the axis of the ctenidium lies by the side of the body, and is very
frequently connate with the body, as so often happens in Gastropods
also, we find it convenient to speak of the two plate-like structures
formed on each ctenidial axis as the outer and the inner gill-plate;
each of these is composed of two lamellae, an outer (the
reflected) and an adaxial in the case of the outer gill-plate,
and an adaxial and an inner (the reflected) in the
case of the inner gill-plate. This is the condition seen in
<i>Arca</i> and <i>Mytilus</i>, the so-called plates dividing upon the
slightest touch into their constituent filaments, which
are but loosely conjoined by their &ldquo;ciliated junctions.&rdquo;
Complications follow upon this in other forms. Even in
<i>Mytilus</i> and <i>Arca</i> a connexion is here and there formed
between the ascending and descending rami of a filament
by hollow extensible outgrowths called &ldquo;interlamellar
junctions&rdquo; (<i>il.</i> <i>j</i> in B, fig. 11). Nevertheless the filament
is a complete tube formed of chitinous substance and
clothed externally by ciliated epithelium, internally by endothelium
and lacunar tissue&mdash;a form of connective tissue&mdash;as shown in fig. 11, C.
Now let us suppose as happens in the genus <i>Dreissensia</i>&mdash;a genus not far
removed from <i>Mytilus</i>&mdash;that the ciliated inter-filamentar junctions
(fig. 12) give place to solid permanent inter-filamentar junctions, so
that the filaments are converted, as it were, into a trellis-work.
Then let us suppose that the interlamellar junctions already noted
in <i>Mytilus</i> become very numerous, large and irregular; by them the
two trellis-works of filaments would be united so as to leave only a
sponge-like set of spaces between them. Within the trabeculae of
the sponge-work blood circulates, and between the trabeculae the
water passes, having entered by the apertures left in the trellis-work
formed by the united gill-filaments (fig. 14). The larger the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
intralamellar spongy growth becomes, the more do the original gill-filaments
lose the character of blood-holding tubes, and tend to become
dense elastic rods for the simple purpose of supporting the spongy
growth. This is seen both in the section of <i>Dreissensia</i> gill (fig. 12)
and in those of <i>Anodonta</i> (fig. 13, A, B, C). In the drawing of <i>Dreissensia</i>
the individual filaments <i>f</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>f</i> are cut across in one lamella at the
horizon of an inter-filamentar junction, in the other (lower in the
figure) at a point where they are free. The chitinous substance <i>ch</i> is
observed to be greatly thickened as compared with what it is in
fig. 11, C, tending in fact to obliterate altogether the lumen of the
filament. And in <i>Anodonta</i> (fig. 13, C) this obliteration is effected.
In <i>Anodonta</i>, besides being thickened, the skeletal substance of the
filament develops a specially dense, rod-like body on each side of each
filament. Although the structure of the ctenidium is thus highly
complicated in <i>Anodonta</i>, it is yet more so in some of the siphonate
genera of Lamellibranchs. The filaments take on a secondary
grouping, the surface of the lamella being thrown into a series of half-cylindrical
ridges, each consisting of ten or twenty filaments; a
filament of much greater strength and thickness than the others may
be placed between each pair of groups. In <i>Anodonta</i>, as in many
other Lamellibranchs, the ova and hatched embryos are carried for a
time in the ctenidia or gill apparatus, and in this particular case the
space between the two lamellae of the outer gill-plate is that which
serves to receive the ova (fig. 13, A). The young are nourished by a
substance formed by the cells which cover the spongy interlamellar
outgrowths.</p>

<p class="pt2">Other points in the modification of the typical ctenidium must be
noted in order to understand the ctenidium of <i>Anodonta</i>. The axis
of each ctenidium, right and left, starts from a point well forward
near the labial tentacles, but it is at first only a ridge, and does not
project as a free cylindrical axis until the back part of the foot is
reached. This is difficult to see in <i>Anodonta</i>, but if the mantle-skirt
be entirely cleared away, and if the dependent lamellae which spring
from the ctenidial axis be carefully cropped so as to leave the axis
itself intact, we obtain the form shown in fig. 15, where <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> are
respectively the left and the right ctenidial axes projecting freely
beyond the body. In <i>Arca</i> this can be seen with far less trouble, for
the filaments are more easily removed than are the consolidated
lamellae formed by the filaments of <i>Anodonta</i>, and in <i>Arca</i> the free
axes of the ctenidia are large and firm in texture (fig. 9, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>).</p>

<p class="pt2">If we were to make a vertical section across the long axis of a
Lamellibranch which had the axis of its ctenidium free from its origin
onwards, we should find such relations as are shown in the diagram
fig. 16, A. The gill axis <i>d</i> is seen lying in the sub-pallial chamber
between the foot <i>b</i> and the mantle <i>c</i>. From it depend the gill-filaments
or lamellae&mdash;formed by united filaments&mdash;drawn as black
lines <i>f</i>. On the left side these lamellae are represented as having only
a small reflected growth, on the right side the reflected ramus or
lamella is complete (<i>fr</i> and <i>er</i>). The actual condition in <i>Anodonta</i> at
the region where the gills begin anteriorly is shown in fig. 16, B.
The axis of the ctenidium is seen to be adherent to, or fused by concrescence
with, the body-wall, and moreover on each side the outer
lamella of the outer gill-plate is fused to the mantle, whilst the inner
lamella of the inner gill-plate is fused to the foot. If we take another
section nearer the hinder margin of the foot, we get the arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
shown diagrammatically in fig. 16, C, and more correctly in fig. 17.
In this region the inner lamellae of the inner gill-plates are no longer
affixed to the foot. Passing still farther back behind the foot, we
find in <i>Anodonta</i> the condition shown in the section D, fig. 16. The
axes <i>i</i> are now free; the
outer lamellae of the outer
gill-plates (<i>er</i>) still adhere
by concrescence to the
mantle-skirt, whilst the
inner lamellae of the inner
gill-plates meet one another
and fuse by concrescence at
<i>g</i>. In the lateral view of
the animal with reflected
mantle-skirt and gill-plates,
the line of concrescence of
the inner lamellae of the
inner gill-plates is readily
seen; it is marked <i>aa</i> in
fig. 1 (5). In the same
figure the free part of the
inner lamella of the inner
gill-plate resting on the foot
is marked <i>z</i>, whilst the attached
part&mdash;the most
anterior&mdash;has been snipped
with scissors so as to show
the genital and nephridial
apertures <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. The concrescence,
then, of the free
edge of the reflected lamellae
of the gill-plates of Anodon
is very extensive. It is important,
because such a
concrescence is by no means
universal, and does not
occur, for example, in
<i>Mytilus</i> or in <i>Arca</i>; further,
because when its occurrence
is once appreciated, the reduction
of the gill-plates of
<i>Anodonta</i> to the plume-type
of the simplest ctenidium
presents no difficulty; and,
lastly, it has importance in
reference to its physiological
significance. The mechanical
result of the concrescence
of the outer lamellae to the
mantle-flap, and of the inner
lamellae to one another as shown in section D, fig. 16, is that
the sub-pallial space is divided into two spaces by a horizontal
septum. The upper space (<i>i</i>) communicates with the outer world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
by the excurrent or superior siphonal notch of the mantle
(fig. 1, <i>d</i>); the lower space communicates by the lower siphonal
notch (<i>e</i> in fig. 1). The only communication between the two
spaces, excepting through the trellis-work of the gill-plates, is by
the slit (<i>z</i> in fig. 1 (5)) left by
the non-concrescence of a part
of the inner lamella of the
inner gill-plate with the foot.
A probe (<i>g</i>) is introduced
through this slit-like passage,
and it is seen to pass out by the
excurrent siphonal notch. It
is through this passage, or indirectly
through the pores of
the gill-plates, that the water
introduced into the lower sub-pallial
space must pass on its
way to the excurrent siphonal
notch. Such a subdivision of
the pallial chamber, and direction
of the currents set up within
it do not exist in a number of
Lamellibranchs which have the
gill-lamellae comparatively free
(<i>Mytilus</i>, <i>Arca</i>, <i>Trigonia</i>, &amp;c.),
and it is in these forms that
there is least modification by
concrescence of the primary
filamentous elements of the
lamellae.</p>

<p class="pt2">In the 9th edition of this
Encyclopaedia Professor (Sir)
E. R. Lankester suggested that
these differences of gill-structure
would furnish characters
of classificatory value, and
this suggestion has been
followed out by Dr Paul
Pelseneer in the classification now generally adopted.</p>

<p>The alimentary canal of <i>Anodonta</i> is shown in fig. 1 (4). The
mouth is placed between the anterior adductor and the foot; the
anus opens on a median papilla overlying the posterior adductor,
and discharges into the superior pallial chamber along which the
excurrent stream passes. The coil of the intestine in <i>Anodonta</i> is
similar to that of other Lamellibranchs. The rectum traverses the
pericardium, and has the ventricle of the heart wrapped, as it were,
around it. This is not an unusual arrangement in Lamellibranchs,
and a similar disposition occurs in some Gastropoda (<i>Haliotis</i>). A
pair of ducts (<i>ai</i>) lead from the first enlargement of the alimentary
tract called stomach into a pair of large digestive glands, the so-called
liver, the branches of which are closely packed in this region
(<i>af</i>). The food of the <i>Anodonta</i>, as of other Lamellibranchs, consists
of microscopic animal and vegetable organisms, brought to the mouth
by the stream which sets into the sub-pallial chamber at the lower
siphonal notch (<i>e</i> in fig. 1). Probably a straining of water from solid
particles is effected by the lattice-work of the ctenidia or
gill-plates.</p>

<p>The heart of <i>Anodonta</i> consists of a median ventricle embracing the
rectum (fig. 18, A), and giving off an anterior and a posterior artery,
and of two auricles which open into the ventricle by orifices protected
by valves.</p>

<p class="pt2">The blood is colourless, and has colourless amoeboid corpuscles
floating in it. In <i>Ceratisolen legumen</i>, various species of <i>Arca</i> and a
few other species the blood is crimson, owing to the presence of
corpuscles impregnated with haemoglobin. In <i>Anodonta</i> the blood
is driven by the ventricle through the arteries into vessel-like spaces,
which soon become irregular lacunae surrounding the viscera, but
in parts&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> the labial tentacles and walls of the gut&mdash;very fine
vessels with endothelial cell-lining are found. The blood makes its
way by large veins to a venous sinus which lies in the middle line
below the heart, having the paired renal organs (nephridia) placed
between it and that organ. Hence it passes through the vessels of
the glandular walls of the nephridia right and left into the gill-lamellae,
whence it returns through many openings into the widely-stretched
auricles. In the filaments of the gill of Protobranchia and
many Filibranchia the tubular cavity is divided by a more or less
complete fibrous septum into two channels, for an afferent and
efferent blood-current. The ventricle and auricles of <i>Anodonta</i> lie in a
pericardium which is clothed with a pavement endothelium (<i>d</i>, fig. 18).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
It does not contain blood or communicate directly with the blood-system;
this isolation of the pericardium we have noted already in
Gastropods and Cephalopods. A good case for the examination of
the question as to whether blood enters the pericardium of Lamellibranchs,
or escapes from the foot, or by the renal organs when the
animal suddenly contracts, is furnished by the <i>Ceratisolen legumen</i>,
which has red blood-corpuscles. According to observations made by
Penrose on an uninjured <i>Ceratisolen legumen</i>, no red corpuscles are
to be seen in the pericardial
space, although the heart is
filled with them, and no such
corpuscles are ever discharged
by the animal when it is
irritated.</p>

<p>The pair of renal organs of
<i>Anodonta</i>, called in Lamellibranchs
the organs of Bojanus,
lie below the membranous floor
of the pericardium, and open
into it by two well-marked
apertures (<i>e</i> and <i>f</i> in fig. 18).
Each nephridium, after being
bent upon itself as shown in
fig. 18, C, D, opens to the
exterior by a pore placed at the
point marked <i>x</i> in fig. 1 (5) (6).
One half of each nephridium is
of a dark-green colour and
glandular (<i>h</i> in fig. 18). This
opens into the reflected portion
which overlies it as shown in
the diagram fig. 18, D, <i>i</i>; the
latter has non-glandular walls,
and opens by the pore <i>k</i> to the
exterior. The renal organs
may be more ramified in other
Lamellibranchs than they are
in <i>Anodonta</i>. In some they
are difficult to discover. That
of the common oyster was described
by Hoek. Each nephridium
in the oyster is a
pyriform sac, which communicates
by a narrow canal with
the urino-genital groove placed to the front of the great adductor
muscle; by a second narrow canal it communicates with the
pericardium. From all parts of the pyriform sac narrow stalk-like
tubes are given off, ending in abundant widely-spread branching
glandular caeca, which form the essential renal secreting apparatus.
The genital duct opens by a pore into the urino-genital groove of the
oyster (the same arrangement being repeated on each side of the body)
close to but distinct from the aperture of the nephridial canal.
Hence, except for the formation of a urino-genital groove, the apertures
are placed as they are in <i>Anodonta</i>. Previously to Hoek&rsquo;s
discovery a brown-coloured investment of the auricles of the heart of
the oyster had been supposed to represent the nephridia in a rudimentary
state. This investment, which occurs also in many Filibranchia,
forms the pericardial glands, comparable to the pericardial
accessory glandular growths of Cephalopoda. In <i>Unionidae</i> and
several other forms the pericardial glands are extended into diverticula
of the pericardium which penetrate the
mantle and constitute the organ of Heber.
The glands secrete hippuric acid which passes
from the pericardium into the renal organs.</p>

<p><i>Nervous System and Sense-Organs.</i>&mdash;In
<i>Anodonta</i> there are three well-developed pairs
of nerve ganglia (fig. 19, B, and fig. 1 (6)).
An anterior pair, lying one on each side of
the mouth (fig. 19, B, <i>a</i>) and connected in
front of it by a commissure, are the representatives
of the cerebral and pleural ganglia
of the typical Mollusc, which are not here
differentiated as they are in Gastropods. A
pair placed close together in the foot (fig.
19, B, <i>b</i>, and fig. 1 (6), <i>ax</i>) are the typical
pedal ganglia; they are joined to the cerebro-pleural
ganglia by connectives.</p>

<p>Posteriorly beneath the posterior adductors, and covered only by
a thin layer of elongated epidermal cells, are the visceral ganglia.
United with these ganglia on the outer sides are the osphradial
ganglia, above which the epithelium is modified to form a pair of
sense-organs, corresponding to the osphradia of other Molluscs. In
some Lamellibranchs the osphradial ganglia receive nerve-fibres, not
from the visceral ganglia, but from the cerebral ganglia along the
visceral commissure. Formerly the posterior pair of ganglia were
identified as simply the osphradial ganglia, and the anterior pair as
the cerebral, pleural and visceral ganglia united into a single pair.
But it has since been discovered that in the Protobranchia the
cerebral ganglia and the pleural are distinct, each giving origin to
its own connective which runs to the pedal ganglion. The cerebro-pedal
and pleuro-pedal connectives, however, in these cases are only
separate in the initial parts of their course, and unite together for the
lower half of their length, or for nearly the whole length. Moreover,
in many forms, in which in the adult condition there is only a single
pair of anterior ganglia and a single pedal connective, a pleural
ganglion distinct from the cerebral has been recognized in the course
of development. There is, however, no evidence of the union of a
visceral pair with the cerebro-pleural.</p>

<p class="pt2">The sense-organs of <i>Anodonta</i> other than the osphradia consist of
a pair of otocysts attached to the pedal ganglia (fig. 1 (6), <i>ay</i>). The
otocysts of <i>Cyclas</i> are peculiarly favourable for study on account of
the transparency of the small foot in which they lie, and may be taken
as typical of those of Lamellibranchs generally. The structure of
one is exhibited in fig. 20. A single otolith is present as in the veliger
embryos of Opisthobranchia. In Filibranchia and many Protobranchia
the otocyst (or statocyst) contains numerous particles
(otoconia). The organs are developed as invaginations of the epidermis
of the foot, and in the majority of the Protobranchia the
orifice of invagination remains open throughout life; this is also the
case in <i>Mytilus</i> including the common mussel.</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Anodonta</i> has no eyes of any sort, and the tentacles on the mantle
edge are limited to its posterior border. This deficiency is very usual
in the class; at the same time, many Lamellibranchs have tentacles
on the edge of the mantle supplied by a pair of large well-developed
nerves, which are given off from the cerebro-pleural ganglion-pair,
and very frequently some of these tentacles have undergone a special
metamorphosis converting them into highly-organized eyes. Such
eyes on the mantle-edge are found in <i>Pecten</i>, <i>Spondylus</i>, <i>Lima</i>, <i>Pinna</i>,
<i>Pectunculus</i>, <i>Modiola</i>, <i>Cardium</i>, <i>Tellina</i>, <i>Mactra</i>, <i>Venus</i>, <i>Solen</i>,
<i>Pholas</i> and <i>Galeomma</i>. They are totally distinct from the cephalic
eyes of typical Mollusca, and have a different structure and historical
development. They have originated not as pits but as tentacles.
They agree with the dorsal eyes of <i>Oncidium</i> (Pulmonata) in the curious
fact that the optic nerve penetrates the capsule of the eye and
passes in front of the retinal body (fig. 21), so that its fibres join the
anterior faces of the nerve-end cells as in Vertebrates, instead of
their posterior faces as in the cephalic eyes of Mollusca and Arthropoda;
moreover, the lens is not a cuticular product but a cellular
structure, which, again, is a feature of agreement with the Vertebrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
eye. It must, however, be distinctly borne in mind that there is a
fundamental difference between the eye of Vertebrates and of all
other groups in the fact that in the Vertebrata the retinal body is
itself a part of the central nervous system, and not a separate
modification of the epidermis&mdash;myelonic as opposed to epidermic.
The structure of the reputed eyes of several of the above-named
genera has not been carefully examined. In <i>Pecten</i> and <i>Spondylus</i>,
however, they have been fully studied (see fig. 21, and explanation).
Rudimentary cephalic eyes occur in the <i>Mytilidae</i> and in <i>Avicula</i> at
the base of the first filament of the inner gill, each consisting of a
pigmented epithelial fossa containing a cuticular lens. In the
<i>Arcidae</i> the pallial eyes are compound or faceted somewhat like those
of Arthropods.</p>

aperture closes&mdash;the pedicle of invagination, or narrow neck of the
invaginated arch-enteron, becoming the intestine. The mouth and
the anus are formed as independent in-pushings, the mouth with
stomodaeum first, and the short anal proctodaeum much later.
This interpretation of the appearances is contrary to that of Horst,
from whom our drawings of the oyster&rsquo;s development are taken.
The account given by the American William K. Brooks differs greatly
as to matter of fact from that of Horst, and appears to be erroneous in

<p><i>Generative Organs.</i>&mdash;The gonads of <i>Anodonta</i> are placed in distinct
male and female individuals. In some Lamellibranchs&mdash;for instance,
the European Oyster and the <i>Pisidium pusillum</i>&mdash;the sexes
are united in the same individual; but here, as in most hermaphrodite
animals, the two sexual elements are not ripe in the same
individual at the same moment. It has been conclusively shown
that the <i>Ostrea edulis</i> does not fertilize itself. The American Oyster
(<i>O. virginiana</i>) and the Portuguese
Oyster (<i>O. angulata</i>) have the sexes
separate, and fertilization is effected
in the open water after the discharge
of the ova and the spermatozoa
from the females and males
respectively. In the <i>Ostrea edulis</i>
fertilization of the eggs is effected
at the moment of their escape from
the uro-genital groove, or even
before, by means of spermatozoa
drawn into the sub-pallial chamber
by the incurrent ciliary stream, and
the embryos pass through the early
stages of development whilst entangled
between the gill-lamellae of
the female parent (fig. 23). In
<i>Anodonta</i> the eggs pass into the
space between the two lamellae of
the outer gill-plate, and are there
fertilized, and advance whilst still in
this position to the glochidium phase
of development (fig. 22). They may
be found here in thousands in the
summer and autumn months. The
gonads themselves are extremely
simple arborescent glands which
open to the exterior by two simple
ducts, one right and one left, continuous
with the tubular branches of the gonads. In the most primitive
Lamellibranchs there is no separate generative aperture but the
gonads discharge into the renal cavity, as in <i>Patella</i> among Gastropods.
This is the case in the Protobranchia, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Solenomya</i>, in which
the gonad opens into the reno-pericardial duct. But the generative
products do not pass through the whole length of the renal tube:
there is a direct opening from the pericardial end of the tube to the
distal end, and the ova or sperms pass through this. In <i>Arca</i>, in
<i>Anomiidae</i> and in <i>Pectinidae</i> the gonad opens into the external part
of the renal tube. The next stage of modification is seen in <i>Ostraea</i>,
<i>Cyclas</i> and some <i>Lucinidae</i>, in which the generative and renal ducts
open into a cloacal slit on the surface of the body. In <i>Mytilus</i> the
two apertures are on a common papilla, in other cases the two apertures
are as in <i>Anodonta</i>. The Anatinacea and <i>Poromya</i> among the
Septibranchia are, however, peculiar in having two genital apertures
on each side, one male and one female. These forms are hermaphrodite,
with an ovary and testis completely separate from each other
on each side of the body, each having its own duct and aperture.</p>

<p class="pt2">The development of <i>Anodonta</i> is remarkable for the curious larval
form known as <i>glochidium</i> (fig. 22). The glochidium quits the gill-pouch
of its parent and swims by alternate opening and shutting of
the valves of its shell, as do adult <i>Pecten</i> and <i>Lima</i>, trailing at the
same time a long byssus thread. This byssus is not homologous with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
that of other Lamellibranchs, but originates from a single glandular
epithelial cell embedded in the tissues on the dorsal anterior side of
the adductor muscle. By this it is brought into contact with the fin
of a fish, such as perch, stickleback or others, and effects a hold
thereon by means of the toothed edge of its shells. Here it becomes
encysted, and is nourished by the exudations of the fish. It remains
in this condition for a period of two to six weeks, and during this time
the permanent organs are developed from the cells of two symmetrical
cavities behind the adductor muscle. The early larva of
<i>Anodonta</i> is not unlike the trochosphere of other Lamellibranchs, but
the mouth is wanting. The glochidium is formed by the precocious
development of the anterior adductor and the retardation of all the
other organs except the shell. Other Lamellibranchs exhibit either
a trochosphere larva which
becomes a veliger differing only
from the Gastropod&rsquo;s and
Pteropod&rsquo;s veliger in having
bilateral shell-calcifications instead
of a single central one;
or, like <i>Anodonta</i>, they may
develop within the gill-plates
of the mother, though without
presenting such a specialized
larva as the glochidium. An
example of the former is seen
in the development of the European
oyster, to the figure of
which and its explanation the
reader is specially referred (fig.
23). An example of the latter
is seen in a common little fresh-water
bivalve, the <i>Pisidium
pusillum</i>, which has been studied
by Lankester. The gastrula is
formed in this case by invagination.
The embryonic cells continue
to divide, and form an
oval vesicle containing liquid
(fig. 24); within this, at one
pole, is seen the mass of invaginated
cells (fig. 25, <i>hy</i>).
These invaginated cells are the
arch-enteron; they proliferate and give off branching cells, which apply
themselves (fig. 25, C) to the inner face of the vesicle, thus forming
the mesoblast. The outer single layer of cells which constitutes the
surface of the vesicle is the ectoderm or epiblast. The little mass of
hypoblast or enteric cell-mass now enlarges, but remains connected
with the cicatrix of the blastopore or orifice of invagination by a
stalk, the rectal peduncle. The enteron itself becomes bilobed and
is joined by a new invagination, that of the mouth and stomodaeum.
The mesoblast multiplies its cells, which become partly muscular and
partly skeleto-trophic. Centro-dorsally now appears the embyronic
shell-gland. The pharynx or stomodaeum is still small,
the foot not yet prominent. A later stage is seen in fig. 26, where
the pharynx is widely open and the foot prominent. No ciliated
velum or pre-oral (cephalic) lobe ever develops. The shell-gland
disappears, the mantle-skirt is raised as a ridge, the paired shell-valves
are secreted, the anus opens by a proctodaeal ingrowth into
the rectal peduncle, and the rudiments of the gills (<i>br</i>) and of the
renal organs (B) appear (fig. 26, lateral view), and thus the chief
organs and general form of the adult are acquired. Later changes
consist in the growth of the shell-valves over the whole area of the
mantle-flaps, and in the multiplication of the gill-filaments and their
consolidation to form gill-plates. It is important to note that the
gill-filaments are formed one by one <i>posteriorly</i>. The labial tentacles
are formed late. In the allied genus <i>Cyclas</i>, a byssus gland is formed
in the foot and subsequently disappears, but no such gland occurs in
<i>Pisidium</i>.</p>

<p>An extraordinary modification of the veliger occurs in the development
of <i>Nucula</i> and <i>Yoldia</i> and probably other members of the
same families. After the formation of the gastrula by epibole the
larva becomes enclosed by an ectodermic test covering the whole of
the original surface of the body, including the shell-gland, and
leaving only a small opening at the posterior end in which the stomodaeum
and proctodaeum are formed. In <i>Yoldia</i> and <i>Nucula proxima</i>
the test consists of five rows of flattened cells, the three median rows
bearing circlets of long cilia. At the anterior end of the test is the
apical plate from the centre of which projects a long flagellum as in
many other Lamellibranch larvae. In <i>Nucula delphinodonta</i> the test
is uniformly covered with short cilia, and there is no flagellum.
When the larval development is completed the test is cast off, its
cells breaking apart and falling to pieces leaving the young animal
with a well-developed shell exposed and the internal organs in an
advanced state. The test is really a ciliated velum developed in the
normal position at the apical pole but reflected backwards in such
a way as to cover the original ectoderm except at the posterior end.
In <i>Yoldia</i> and <i>Nucula proxima</i> the ova are set free in the water and
the test-larvae are free-swimming, but in <i>Nucula delphinodonta</i>
the female forms a thin-walled egg-case of mucus attached to the
posterior end of the shell and in communication with the pallial
chamber; in this case the eggs develop and the test-larva is enclosed.
A similar modification of the velum occurs in <i>Dentalium</i> and
in <i>Myzomenia</i> among the Amphineura.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">Classification of Lamellibranchia</span></p>

<p>The classification originally based on the structure of the
gills by P. Pelseneer included five orders, viz.: the Protobranchia
in which the gill-filaments are flattened and not reflected; the
Filibranchia in which the filaments are long and reflected, with
non-vascular junctions; the Pseudolamellibranchia in which
the gill-lamellae are vertically folded, the inter-filamentar and
interlamellar junctions being vascular or non-vascular; the
Eulamellibranchia in which the inter-filamentar and interlamellar
junctions are vascular; and lastly the Septibranchia
in which the gills are reduced to a horizontal partition. The
Pseudolamellibranchia included the oyster, scallop and their
allies which formerly constituted the order Monomyaria, having
only a single large adductor muscle or in addition a very small
anterior adductor. The researches of W. G. Ridewood have
shown that in gill-structure the Pectinacea agree with the Filibranchia
and the Ostraeacea with the Eulamellibranchia, and
accordingly the order Pseudolamellibranchia is now suppressed
and its members divided between the two other orders mentioned.
The four orders now retained exhibit successive stages in the
modification of the ctenidia by reflection and concrescence of
the filament, but other organs, such as the heart, adductors,
renal organs, may not show corresponding stages. On the
contrary considerable differences in these organs may
occur within any single order. The Protobranchia, however,
possess several primitive characters besides that of
the branchiae. In them the foot has a flat ventral surface
used for creeping, as in Gastropods, the byssus gland
is but slightly developed, the pleural ganglia are distinct,
there is a relic of the pharyngeal cavity, in some forms
with a pair of glandular sacs, the gonads retain their
primitive connexion with the renal cavities, and the
otocysts are open.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">Order I. <span class="sc">Protobranchia</span></p>

<p>In addition to the characters given above, it may be
noted that the mantle is provided with a hypobranchial
gland on the outer side of each gill, the auricles are
muscular, the kidneys are glandular through their whole
length, the sexes are separate.</p>
